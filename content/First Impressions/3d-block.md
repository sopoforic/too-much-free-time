A falling blocks game, which appears from the title screen to be an adult game. Is it? See inside:

I'll answer now, to spare you any anxiety: if it's an adult game, no one will ever know, because it's impossible to get anything done.

It's not too hard to rotate the shape when it's at the top, but once it gets further down it's nigh impossible to tell how it's oriented. Furthermore, it's very hard to tell at a glance what the levels below the top are like.

And what is that box on the lower right? Is it supposed to help me guide my blocks? It shows four blocks per level. There are sixteen blocks per level in truth. I don't know how this is meant to help, but it's about as useful as dictionary with every other letter missing--you know there's more to it, but it doesn't do you any good.

With all these faults, the only thing that let me complete the first level was the the blocks fall slowly--painfully slowly. You can press start to drop the block all the way, but there's no way to move it down just a bit. When the second level comes, though, this isn't a problem. Where the first level was far too slow, the second level is impossibly fast. The blocks fall completely in about a second, which is nowhere near enough time to orient them, much less position them accurately. So, we get this:

And the game is thankfully over.

Verdict: This game shows why 3D should not be done on an NES. The 2D Tetris games are pretty good on the NES, so if you want falling blocks, play those instead.
