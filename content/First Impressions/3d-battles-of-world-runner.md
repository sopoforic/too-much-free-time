Run around, avoiding the enemies, until you get to the boss. Then button mash.

It's kind of dull, since all there is to do is move forward, at varying rates of speed, and jump. You get a rocket, which actually looks like a pink fireball when you use it, but I can't imagine what it's good for since any enemy you hit with the rocket wouldn't have been there when you actually run past it, and the enemies which weren't in your line of fire will run into you.

You have to jump over some pits as you go. Since the game doesn't have real 3D, you can't really tell how wide the pits are until you're in the air, so you have to try to land in the right spot by changing speed in the air. Sometimes you have only a small area to land, so I kept overshooting or actually smacking my face on the edge of the ground and then sliding down to my death. When you finish the level you fight this centipede-thing:

That's a picture from before the game starts, since I neglected to take a screenshot while actually fighting it. Suffice to say you fire the pink rocket-fireballs at it until it dies. I have no clue how it is intended to hurt you, since it doesn't seem to have any rockets of its own. Or arms. Or anything.

The second level is like the first, except grey. I assume that the others follow suit. The game also has an anaglyph 3D mode, activated by pressing select. I have not yet mustered the courage to try this.

Verdict: It's not bad, but it wouldn't hold my attention for long.
