Original title: ""РЕДАКТОР ТЕКСТОВ"". In Latin characters: "REDAKTOR TEKSTOV".

Broken, probably. I'm not sure what it's supposed to do, but it just shows several screens of text then loops. Nestopia complains about bad header info, or something. The first and last screens are:

![Text Editor first screen]({filename}../images/Text-Editor_01.png)

![Text Editor last screen]({filename}../images/Text-Editor_02.png)

And that is that.

Update: According to the [BootlegGames Wiki][blg], this program needs a printer. I wasn't aware that such a thing existed, but apparently some Famiclones had a printer port. The more you know!
