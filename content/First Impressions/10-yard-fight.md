It's an American football game. I don't know the rules of the game, but, honestly, I doubt that matters for this game.

We start the game running down the field, and quickly meet the opposing team:

This scene repeats, with the referee running out every few seconds, since I'm tackled every time I move. I don't think there are any controls except 'throw ball before running' and 'run.' Once I mastered this fiendishly clever control scheme, it was just a matter of seeing whether my patience or the field ran out first. It turns out that my patience won, so I got the joy of getting to the end--then starting again! Pathetic.

A little searching tells me that if I had been willing to spend a half hour playing this game, I'd have gotten to play defense as well as offense. Fortunately, everyone seems to agree that it's be stupid to waste that much time on this one, so I'll bow to the wisdom of the internets.

Verdict: Don't play this one.
