Tasac is a vertical scrolling shooter by Sachen, and it sucks.

The title screen looks pretty cool, so one might expect the game to have decent graphics, or something. Most of your in-game time is spent in a position like this one:

There's no real challenge in this part, except that the laser-like weapon you start with sucks, and the upgrades suck even more. When you get to the end, the boss appears.

But you can't kill it yet. In fact, you can fly right over it. Why is the boss there before you're able to interact with it? I don't know. But the game carries on just as if the boss weren't there. In fact, it carries on the same way even once you can fight the boss--the random enemies keep appearing, there's just a boss on the screen at the same time.

Although the boss shoots a pretty large number of projectiles at you, they're not hard to dodge. If the weapon weren't so stupidly slow and hard to use, they boss wouldn't be even slightly difficult. As it is, the boss just takes a little longer than it ought to.

The second level was just like the first. I think that the boss was slightly rounder, but I don't really care to recall.

Verdict: Pointless. It's just a below average vertical scroller.
