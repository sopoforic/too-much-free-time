Yeah, it's out of order. I hit 'random game I haven't played' and I got this:

Flying Warriors. It sounds like some kind of shooter maybe. Airplane game. That's cool, I liked 1943. So, what do I get? Castlevania if it sucked and had a boring training sequence. But before training, some important wisdom:

Okay, on to the training. Since the designers went to all the trouble of putting in training, this game must have some complex controls, or something. Let's see:

Yes, that's right. Toward automatically blocks at the right level, and B automatically punches at the right level. You get to practice these complex manoeuvres several times before you grasp them fully.

Yes! I am a master! I can now go out and make the world a better place! But, first, a practice match against sensei. Well, sure. I'm a master now. Piece of cake.

So we fight and... he beats me down. Badly.

So it's back to training. Never mind that training couldn't possibly help me, and that a monkey could manage these controls. So, we train again, he declares me a master again, we fight again, I lose again. Repeat. Repeat...

Finally, I win. So we get a scene change.

![Empty screen]({filename}images/Flying-Warriors_13.png)

So, the game begins with an exciting... empty screen! I have to move off it to an entirely different scene to get to the actual game. What was the point? Why waste my time putting this scene in if there's nothing here? The next scene is some kind of mountain area, which kind of matches with the description, but that does not explain what the point of this last scene was.

So, after that painfully long training and practice fight, we expect challenge, yes? But the enemies all die in one hit! The hardest part is managing the movement controls, since it seems to be impossible to make Rick (our hero) jump the way you want him to. After a couple of screens full of these zombie-like wimps, we enter a cave, filled with more of the same, as well as the far more dangerous bottomless pits.

In fact, these pits are so much more dangerous, that they even kill the enemies, who just jump off like lemmings. But, remember how I said that jumping correctly was the hardest part?

![Pits!]({filename}images/Flying-Warriors_18.png)

Yes, I too jump off like a lemming. The game tells me that Rick doesn't let this stop him. Fortunately, it does stop me.

Verdict: You can't skip the long intro, you have to go through boring training and practice fights, only to get to a game that acts like a bad rip off of Castlevania. Better to leave this one alone.
