*Hanoi* by Glen Fisher, published in *Cursor* #05 (Nov. 1978), is a Tower of Hanoi game for the Commodore PET.

*Hanoi*, like most Tower of Hanoi games for Commodore computers, is a very simple and straightforward implementation. The rules should be familiar to most of us, but you may [see Wikipedia for details][hanoiwp]. In this version, you select the number of discs in the puzzle, between two and seven, and then you are prompted from which pile to pick up a disc, and onto which pile to place it.

The discs move with a simple but smooth animation--nice enough, I suppose, at first, but it would get very tiresome indeed in the 127 moves it takes to solve a puzzle with seven discs. Upon completion of the puzzle, the game tells you how many moves you used, and how many were required, at minimum.

While I doubt anyone will be much interested in a simple Tower of Hanoi game in any case, I'll still recommend against this particular version. It's not bad, for what it is, but it's got nothing in particular to recommend it, either.

Two updated versions of *Hanoi* were released, one in 1980, and another in 1984, which included color but were otherwise similar.
