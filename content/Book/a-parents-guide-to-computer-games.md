In my quest to save marginal game-related information from the depths of obscurity, I came across this book, [*A Parent's Guide to Computer Games*][bookam] by Craig Wessel.

Its back cover is very ominous:

>Your kids know what "RPG" means. <big>Do you?</big>

Surprisingly, it's a fairly decent book, given its focus. The first half is given to discussing generalities: the game platforms of the day (Windows, Macintosh, N64, Game Boy, PS1, PS2, Dreamcast); game platforms to come (Xbox, Gamecube, Game Boy Advance, even Linux is given a few paragraphs); surprisingly, a brief mention of emulation, specifically Bleem and Bleemcast; discussion of the various types and genres of games; a few pages devoted to online games, including specifically EverQuest and Ultima Online; finally, an explanation of the ESRB's rating system.

The second half, of course, is devoted to the games, including one to three page reviews of each featured game.

I've uploaded the table of contents for the review section, above. It includes many notable games, including *Age of Empires 2*, *Deux Ex*, *Diablo 2*, *Half-Life*, *Civilization 2*, *Roller Coaster Tycoon*, *Sim City 3000*, *The Sims*, *StarCraft*, and *Unreal Tournament* in its "Hot Titles" section, and a fair mix of others (from *Icewind Dale* to *Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?*) in the other sections.

This book was published in 2000, so it's only about 14 years old, today. That said, I think it's worth looking back to see just how things were perceived even as recently as that. The book predicts that Sony wouldn't be able to do much about Bleem, and notes, of Linux, that "game developers have embraced the operating system", though it's cautious about Linux's future prospects.

I'm looking at some other examples of this type of book, as well. Secondary materials won't be forgotten, if I have anything to say about it!
