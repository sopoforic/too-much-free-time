Initiates into the mysteries of ancient (computer) history will remember that once there were many games (and other pieces of software) referred to as 'public domain', though this actually meant something more like what we'd call 'shareware' or 'freeware', today--games that could be copied and shared freely.

That usage had something of a resurgence in the emulation community, with so-called 'public domain' ROMs, a contrast with commercial ROMs which had been dumped from carts. In an example of history repeating itself, we once again shifted away from that inaccurate description, and these days we call that kind of ROM 'homebrew'.

There's not much interest in early homebrew ROMs (to be fair, most aren't very interesting), and the web, as ever, suffers significant link rot, so it can be time-consuming to find much information about them. Here, then, is my contribution to the world: information about PD ROMs, with working links, wherever possible.

## Games

### Drymouth

![Drymouth title screen]({filename}images/drymouth-title.png)

A nonogram game like *Mario's Picross*, with some added elements. Quite good, though somewhat more difficult than *Mario's Picross*.

Released 2001-01-01 (according to the readme, though the files are dated a few days later) by its developer, Steve Demeter.

*Drymouth* can be downloaded from (an archived copy of) [Demiforce's website][demiforce].

## Demos

### Blem! The World's First Playstation Emulator for GB

![Blem!]({filename}images/blem.png)

This demo is just a tiny joke. The screenshot to the right is the whole thing. It first shows the title and tagline. After a button press it says "Now Loading System Bios...". Some dots appear to simulate activity, then it says "Unknown OpCode!". And that's it.

I don't know who created *Blem!*. The demo offers no hint, and looking at the ROM in a hex editor doesn't yield anything, either. My copy of the file is dated 1999-07-03 01:58:00. The ROM was added to Zophar's Domain [on 2000-11-23][zophar]:

<i>23:28:</i>  No, I don't think so. Just a gag. I'm thinking this was made around the time word of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010124061400/http://www.bleem.com/">Bleem!</a> came out to kinda make fun of it.

>You can download Blem! The Playstation Emulator for the Gameboy! from our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010124061400/http://www.zophar.net/roms/gameboy.html">Gameboy Public Domain ROMs</a> section.

If you're interested in the very limited thrill of seeing a fake PSX emulator fail to run on a Game Boy emulator, you can still [get it from Zophar's Domain][blemdl].

### Diagnostics Rom

![SPRITE.GB]({filename}images/sprite_gb.png)

This is a pack of six ROMs that can be used to test Game Boy emulators.

* A sliding tile puzzle (PUZZLE.GB)
* An RPN calculator (RPN.GB)
* A sound test (SOUND.GB)
* A space demo (SPACE.GB)
* A sprite demo (SPRITE.GB)
* A text and graphics demo (TEST.GB)

The oldest of these, TEST.GB, is dated 1996-04-27. The newest, PUZZLE.GB, is dated 1996-06-13. The others are dated 1996-06-03.

I've got no information on the creator of these ROMs, and I can't tell when they were uploaded to Zophar's Domain--they're present in the [earliest archived copy][oldzophargb] of the Game Boy ROM page, back in 1999-05-08.

These can be [downloaded from Zophar's Domain][diagdl].
