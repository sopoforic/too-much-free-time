Recently, I saw a new game from [Zachtronics Industries][1], _TIS-100_, which was released [on Steam][2] as an early access title on the first of June. In some ways, calling it a game is overstating it: it's little more than a collection of programming problems, with a little story to give it some structure. The catch is that you're programming in an assembly language on a virtual machine with unusual architecture; problems beyond the simplest will generally require you to take advantage of parallelism (which is the primary distinguishing feature of the VM), resulting in novel solutions for ordinary problems.

Obviously, a game like that has a rather limited target audience. Case in point: I have myself previously created a little VM with a fake assembly language to play with. The game is clearly made just for me, but how many others are likely to be similarly interested? About 11,000,[^1] so far. It's a minor hit.[^2]

The concept of programming as gameplay isn't new. Indeed, Zachtronics's earlier game, _SpaceChem_, is also an exercise in parallel programming, though dressed up in fancier clothes. Way back in the mists of time,[^3] _Robot Odyssey_ challenged players to program the titular robots to solve puzzles. And on the more-programming-than-game end of the spectrum, we have *Core War*[^4] and a multitude of web sites in the vein of [Project Euler][3] or [CodinGame][4].

I've been enjoying _TIS-100_, but more than that, I think it's singularly impressive to release a game of this kind. Certainly, there are games that trade on their difficulty (_Super Hexagon_, _I Wanna Be the Guy_, etc.) and some that take pride in their difficulty of interaction (_Surgeon Simulator_, _Ampu-Tea_, _QWOP_, etc.), and simple 'retro-style' graphics are _de rigueur_ for indie games, but the very minimalistic functionalism of _TIS-100_ is astounding.

_TIS-100_ is difficult because the thinking required to solve the puzzles is difficult. It is perhaps inaccessible, because it consists of nothing else _but_ the tools to solve the puzzle. Its graphics are simple because everything you need to solve the puzzles is a text-mode interactive debugger, and that's what you get. Like a sudoku puzzle or a crossword, _TIS-100_ is a completely pure puzzle game: the game takes place in your head, and the software keeps score.

It is not by chance that _TIS-100_ so distinguishes itself from other games. During the production of _Infinifactory_, Zach Barth, the founder of Zachtronics, wanted to make a game with a smaller team--something more-indie-than-indie--to get back to his roots as an indie developer. The project turned out to be too great in scope, but from its wreckage was salvaged a programming minigame which became _TIS-100_.[^5] Viewed as an indie developer's attempt to make something _even more indie_, with the understanding that it was a small part of something larger, the design makes sense.[^6]

The game's manual, too, reflects the niche targeted by the game. Who reads a manual, you ask? When it is positioned as a technical document describing the instruction set of a virtual machine, the answer to that question is: programmers. The manual is presented as the in-universe manual for the TIS-100 computer, previously the property of the player character's Uncle Randy, including handwritten notes and highlighting. This was part of Zachtronics's attempt to make a game with "an irresistible value proposition. For us, that's a game with a 14-page technical manual that we designed, printed out, marked up and scanned back in again."[^7] The manual is reminiscent of the feelies accompanying Infocom games, among others, in years past.[^8]

Like its predecessor, _SpaceChem_, _TIS-100_ encourages players to perfect their solutions, optimizing for either execution speed, least number of nodes used, or least instructions--goals which are often contradictory, requiring multiple solutions.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, given that it is a game about programming, the players of _TIS-100_ have created some auxiliary tools, including [TIS-100 PAD][5],[^9] which allows users to more easily share solutions, and a variety of TIS-100 (the virtual machine, not the game) emulators.[^10]

In addition to this unsolicited community participation, with the release of the specification editor, which allows players to make their own puzzles, a puzzle design contest was announced. Twenty-five puzzles will be selected from the submissions for an official bonus campaign.

The feel of _TIS-100_ is both nostalgic and quite modern. It's an intriguing combination, and I recommend it to anyone still interested after hearing me call it "a collection of programming problems." Coders, no prior experience with assembly is needed. Others, if you like this game--try coding. You'll probably like that, too.

[^4]: Also from 1984, described in a Scientific American article, [Dewdney1984]. It's based on a still earlier programming game, _Darwin_, which was played in 1961 and described publicly in 1972. See [McIlroy1971] for more.

[^6]: However, Barth wrote in a post mortem of _SpaceChem_, [Barth2012], that _SpaceChem_ was too difficult and inaccessible. New titles were forthcoming: "New titles, I might add, that are hopefully more accessible than _SpaceChem_!"
