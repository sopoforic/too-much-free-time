A rather fun *Tetris*-like game.

Palamedes isn't quite the usual falling blocks game. Instead, rows of blocks approach and it is your task to remove them by hitting them with matching block. You select which block to throw at them (from a cycle of six) and try to keep up. It's something like Bust-a-Move, I suppose.

After a few false starts, I made it to stage six. This one would probably be easier using a gamepad, but mine's loaned out, so take the apparent difficulty with a grain of salt.

Verdict: It's a good game. These are few and far between, so I'd check this one out if you're a fan of falling blocks games.
