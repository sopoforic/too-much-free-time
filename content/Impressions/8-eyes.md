This game is like *Castlevania*, except much, much harder.

When the game begins, you select which country to play in first. I understand that it's something like *Megaman*: play in the wrong order, and the game is much harder.

The game really looks quite a lot like *Castlevania*, and plays similarly, too, with one major difference: in *8 Eyes*, you have a falcon with you, and some enemies can only be destroyed by the falcon. Unfortunately, you only have control over the falcon when there are two players--the second player controls the falcon. With one player, the falcon just flies left and right, and your control is limited to telling it to swoop down to attack or return to your shoulder.

The result of this lack of control is that the game is way too hard with one player, and I can't imagine why anyone would play it just to control the falcon. Give this one a miss.
