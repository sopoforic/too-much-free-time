It's horse racing. The title screen greets us, for some reason, with some weird balloon horse things bouncing around:

Maybe the balloon horses were supposed to liven the game up. If so, they failed. There are two modes: race mode and gamble mode. I didn't want to contemplate what might cause you to want to bet on a race controlled by the computer with no real rewards, so I chose race mode. Presumably, it was intended for two players, but it looks like this:

See the little bars with the red balls near them, at the bottom? Those balls were bouncing up and down, and the object was (I deduced) to hit B when yours crossed the center line. Sort of like DDR. Even granted you could find someone else bored enough to play this game, it would be pointless, since it's all but impossible **not** to hit the button at the right time.

Not only is this the only apparent 'challenge' in the game, it goes on forever. You have to go all the way around the track hitting B every half second or so, and that's it. The view switches to overhead when you're on the side of the track, but that doesn't matter since it's still exactly the same worthless game it was when the view was side-on.

Verdict: Don't bother.
