*Novatron* is a DOS lightcycles (tron) game released by VeriSoft Works in 1982.

There have been quite a lot of lightcycle games through the years--[MobyGames lists 10][mobylist], though I suspect it's missing quite a few. The most recent that MobyGames lists is for the Xbox 360 ([Tron][mobytron], 2008), and the oldest is for the Intellivision ([Snafu][mobysnafu], 1981). *Novatron* is a fairly old example of this type of game, and it shows.

Though the graphics are fairly nice, and the controls responsive, *Novatron* is quite difficult to play. The keys used to control your lightcycle are F9, F10, Insert, and Delete, which are poorly placed. It's been a while since I've seen an original IBM PC keyboard, but I don't recall that they would have been in ideal positions on that keyboard either. Positioning aside, I kept confusing which of Ins and Del turned which direction, so I lost quite badly. Too, I found it difficult to tell just how much space I had left before running into a wall, probably due to the viewing angle.

In short, the game isn't terrible, but isn't really worth playing when there are so many better examples of the type. Personally, I'd recommend [Armagetron Advanced][mobyarma].
