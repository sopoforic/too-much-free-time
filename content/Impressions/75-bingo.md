A horrible slots game by Sachen, the company that gave us [Tasac][tasac] and other gems.

I don't have much to say on this one, since I don't see the point of these games that are totally luck-based gambling simulations.

Verdict: Like other Sachen games, and other gambling sims, just don't bother.
