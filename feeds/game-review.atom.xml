But I am writing about a good game, at least: &lt;em&gt;Bleed Out Sakuretsu&lt;/em&gt;, a vertically scrolling shooter for the Sharp X68000, by Gold Cats Project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Bleed-Out-Sakuretsu-title.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First: yes, the title screen says 'sakuretu'. But the common romanization of this game's title seems to be 'sakuretsu', and as goes TOSEC, so goes my nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Bleed-Out-Sakuretsu-ingame.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleed Out Sakuretsu&lt;/em&gt; has a powerup system reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;Gradius&lt;/em&gt;. As you continue scoring points, you can purchase a shot upgrade, a barrier, or other, even more powerful powerups. The opposition is a variety of ships, small shots, and guided missiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Bleed-Out-Sakuretsu-boss.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boss sprays out bullets danmaku-style, and periodically fires a pair of front-facing lasers. You've got to deal with this while avoiding guided missiles, and since you are destroyed in one shot (unless you buy a barrier), this, like the rest of the level, provides a good challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, an unfortunate revelation: the boss is, as far as I can tell, invulnerable, because the available version of &lt;em&gt;Bleed Out Sakuretsu&lt;/em&gt; is a trial edition, and I can find no evidence that any full version was ever created. I would love to hear otherwise, if anyone has better information on old doujin games than I do, because it's a very fun game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMZdr6LtHT8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to do a shooter justice with just words and screenshots. The video above shows (I believe) the entire game, which should give a much better picture of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like shooters, I'd say &lt;em&gt;Bleed Out Sakuretsu&lt;/em&gt; is worth a try. It's only about two minutes long, but it's fun, and I believe there's a place for brief games, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Touhou&lt;/em&gt; series looms largest on the doujin shooter landscape, of course, but there's a huge and fascinating variety of games (of all genres) stretching back decades, which I think could use some more attention from the English-speaking web. I'll probably be looking at a few more doujin games in coming weeks, so I'll try to shine a light on whichever titles catch my eye. Maybe there will be some hidden gems, or maybe just hidden failures. We'll see what comes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="doujin shooter"></category><category term="Gold Cats Project"></category><category term="not on mobygames"></category><category term="vaporware"></category><category term="1996"></category><category term="x68000"></category><category term="vertical scrolling shooter"></category><category term="good"></category></entry><entry><title>History Mystery</title><link href="http://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/history-mystery.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-06-19T13:47:29-04:00</updated><author><name>Tracy Poff</name></author><id>tag:sopoforic.github.io,2015-03-12:too-much-free-time/history-mystery.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the early eighties, the sudden popularity (and, indeed, the recent &lt;em&gt;existence&lt;/em&gt;) of home computers gave rise to a new kind of publication: the disk magazine. These periodicals were published not on paper but on computer disks (and sometimes cassettes), and although the content varied, they generally featured computer programs (including games) in addition to, or even in place of, articles. The most famous of these are perhaps &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softdisk_(disk_magazine)"&gt;Softdisk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for the Apple II (launched in 1981) and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loadstar"&gt;Loadstar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for the Commodore 64 (launched in 1984). The medium flourished&lt;sup id="fnref:diskmags"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:diskmags" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; alongside more traditional magazines which might offer (inconvenient!) type-in programs. There was a price to be paid for this convenience: a single 'issue' of &lt;em&gt;Softdisk&lt;/em&gt; cost about the same as an annual subscription to a paper magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the many disk mags was Scholastic's &lt;em&gt;Microzine&lt;/em&gt; for Apple II. Featuring (as you might expect) primarily educational content, &lt;em&gt;Microzine&lt;/em&gt; began publication in 1983,&lt;sup id="fnref:micropub"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:micropub" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; continuing for about a decade. It also inspired a spin-off series, &lt;em&gt;Microzine Jr.&lt;/em&gt;, which was launched in 1988. Each issue of &lt;em&gt;Microzine&lt;/em&gt; included four programs, one of which was a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="History Mystery title scree" src="http://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Microzine18.Sid_000000004.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which all brings me to the subject of this article: &lt;em&gt;History Mystery&lt;/em&gt; by David A. Bowman and &lt;a href="http://www.highcastle.com/MarkHome/mark.htm"&gt;Mark A. Malamud&lt;/a&gt;, which was included in &lt;em&gt;Microzine&lt;/em&gt; #18 in November 1986. According to the '&lt;a href="https://tmft.wordpress.com/?attachment_id=945"&gt;Letter from the Editor&lt;/a&gt;' in that issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll have fun reading &lt;strong&gt;The History Mystery&lt;/strong&gt; Twistaplot™ adventure. A priceless hourglass has been stolen from the Microville History Museum. Some of the ghosts in the museum will help you find it. (Yes, the museum is haunted!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You play the part of "the ace reporter of your school newspaper, &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;The Chronicle&lt;/span&gt;" (incidentally, &lt;a href="https://tmft.wordpress.com/?attachment_id=953"&gt;of selectable gender&lt;/a&gt;), out to get a story about a stolen Babylonian hourglass. After chatting with the ghost of Mark Twain about the situation, you find yourself in the lobby of the museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Museum lobby" src="http://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Microzine18.Sid_000000014.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The museum consists of 29 rooms&lt;sup id="fnref:map"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:map" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which you must navigate, gathering items and clues to solve the mystery of the stolen hourglass, which the museum's ghosts believe is actually located within the museum. Each room has a description, seen on entering the room, and an entry in the self-guided tape-recorded tour, accessed by pressing &lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;. The tour often contained educational information&lt;sup id="fnref:tour"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:tour" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which might be used to solve the game's puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Age of Dinosaurs room" src="http://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Microzine18.Sid_000000019.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some rooms have items to be collected, while others have ghosts to talk to or other objects to interact with. The game is in two parts (purely for practical reasons, I presume). Selecting the second part from the menu requires the player to input the password given at the end of the first part ("The Sands of Time") and begins the second part, in which the player must collect the hourglass and escape the museum while being chased by Winsome Slugg, the criminal who had stolen it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tracy's Gift Shop" src="http://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/tracys-gift-shop.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon completing the game, the player gets a rather neat reward: the museum's gift shop, called "Amy Minkley's Gift Shop",&lt;sup id="fnref:giftshop"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:giftshop" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; will be renamed after the player. Not only in the ending text, either: in future playthroughs, the in-game name is changed. Which, I suppose, might make this the first game with a New Game+ feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;History Mystery&lt;/em&gt; took me about an hour to complete, though I suppose it took me quite a bit longer when I was a child. I remember having a lot of fun with it, back then, and it's still neat as a bit of nostalgia, today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tales of Suspense" src="http://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/tales-of-suspense.jpg" /&gt;
My copy of the game is this 1987 compilation, &lt;em&gt;Tales of Suspense&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll try to look at some more games from &lt;em&gt;Microzine&lt;/em&gt; and other disk mags in the future. There's a lot to be said about them, and the resources on the internet are scarce at best. This post has been several years in the making, during which time I've been contacted a number of times by people who, like me, had fond memories of a game which &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; have been &lt;em&gt;History Mystery&lt;/em&gt;, but who couldn't be sure. My thanks to them for providing me the impetus to do my civic duty and get this out there. Fans of old educational games, you are appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

Georgiou. You play Sandy, a woman who is trying to discover the name of the man she just spent the night with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One pre-spoiler note: the download from the comp website just has an HTML file with a link to a web-based version of the game, but the story file &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be downloaded, if you follow that link. You'll need a Quest interpreter to play it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This post contains spoilers. Read at your own risk.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a note about online play: the online interpreter was rather slow to react, occasionally taking many seconds to complete a command, and usually missing the first few characters of each command I typed, since it was still scrolling the response text. This was irritating, but it otherwise worked fine, and it was at least visually attractive. Not ideal, but better than nothing, given that I don't actually have a Quest interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ONS&lt;/em&gt; is a short comedy game with one puzzle sequence. I spent about 35 minutes prodding everything in the game before I finished, but I imagine 10 minutes would more than suffice, if you just proceed toward the goal--and particularly if you aren't using the rather slow web-based interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate the customized responses to trying to take various objects, and the randomly chosen sections of text (e.g. when knocking on Mara's door) are a nice touch. The ending, though not &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; unexpected, is a good enough payoff for the few minutes the game takes to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, you don't have any real options--either you proceed linearly through the story, or you don't proceed at all. I wanted to try tricking the dude into saying his name. To break down in tears to avoid the situation. To call him Rumpelstiltskin, if his name is so important. Anything to have some choice--but I had none. More mundanely, there are few objects implemented, and no real, interactive NPCs. The parser is a little obtuse, too: you've got to &lt;strong&gt;knock door&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;use bottle on floor&lt;/strong&gt;, which aren't exactly the first commands that came to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, an average-quality game, which would probably be more at home in the first ifcomp than the twentieth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Post-review pre-posting note&lt;/em&gt;: Okay, I think this review needs an addendum. Other reviewers seem to be unanimous in despising this game. It was my assumption throughout the game that it was a work of parody--the several-inches deep layer of grease on the kitchen floor not a greater exaggeration than the PC's absurd internal monologue. &lt;em&gt;Surely&lt;/em&gt; the game is so stupid exactly because it's undermining its nominal position. Of course, while writing the review, I was under the impression that the author was a woman (Wrong! Giannis is a Greek name which is the masculine form Gianna. The more you know.), and that therefore the PC &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be a parody of the ridiculous caricatures of women we see in games and other media (maybe not?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's against my policy to change my judgment after reading other reviews, so I'll let this review stand as-is. I'd rather be too generous in my assumptions about other people than too harsh. In retrospect, though, if you take seriously the bits that I assumed to be failed comedy, then the game really &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; become rather unpalatable... so take this review with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="female protagonist"></category><category term="ifcomp 2014"></category><category term="2014"></category><category term="freeware"></category><category term="interactive fiction"></category><category term="platform independent"></category><category term="Giannis G.

According to the blurb, it is "A scots fantasia about anxiety. Battle kelpies, watch TV, avoid your emails and find the magical Staff of the Salmon." Sounds amusing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This post contains spoilers. Read at your own risk.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My spoiler warning above goes double for this game. Really definitely don't read this without playing the game. I mean it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you start the game, you're advised that you can "Learn about Scots and use a translator at &lt;a href="http://www.scots-online.org/"&gt;Scots-Online.org&lt;/a&gt;", and you are presented with a pair of links: &lt;strong&gt;gang&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;go&lt;/strong&gt;. It looks from the outset as if the game is simply available in two languages--Scots and English--for flavor, and the "Translate to Scots" and "Translate to English" links that appear reinforce this. The text is even very similar in shape in each language. However, this is only a facade: there are two stories being told, and they are superficially unrelated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Scots-language story, the PC struggles through the day, trying to fill time: "If ye can get tae hauf five, mebbe ye can get tae dinner, than mebbe ye can get tae bed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the English-language story, the PC is on an epic quest: "You are searching for the Staff of the Salmon, whose magic alone will release your clan from the withering curse of Black Edward."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of each page of text is an option to 'translate' into the other language, which actually presents not a translation but the section of the story which is in the corresponding position in the other language: the stories are structurally the same. They are related in more ways that one: at the end of the English-language story, "You imagine another version of yourself, who stayed in bed that fateful day and even now lies frozen in time, unable to act, an endless scream seeking only relief." In the most recent corresponding part of the Scots-language story, the PC is paralyzed by a panic attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My interpretation: the Scots-language story is 'real', and the English-language story is the PC's way of dealing with life--or of &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; dealing with life, as the case may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The duality of the stories is very cool and well done. Though you could (mostly) play them separately, the English-language story serves as commentary on the Scots-language story. For example, when the PC of the Scots-language story is (figuratively) lost in a panic attack, the PC of the English-language story is (literally) lost in a maze. It's an impressive way to use metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The individual stories are well-crafted, too. I particularly liked the use of links to pace the story. Early on, links interrupting the text make the story seem to move slower, but later they make the pacing seem more frantic--well done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll note that my praise is all for 'meta' aspects of the game--this is not an accident. The &lt;em&gt;actual game&lt;/em&gt; isn't all that interesting. The Scots-language story is dull (but it's &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be, since it's the 'real-world' part of the game) and the English-language story is far from engaging. However, the game is quite short (about fifteen minutes for a single playthrough), so this wasn't a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language aspect could prove something of a problem. It's easy enough to tell the general sense of the Scots-language story, but for most readers there will be &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; specific terms that require definition. It's certainly the author's intention to induce readers to learn more about Scots, which is fine, though I wonder how much effort the (non-comp-judging) general public will be willing to expend on comprehension. My own experience with Scots (other than &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_a_Mouse"&gt;Robert Burns&lt;/a&gt;) is limited to an encounter with the &lt;a href="https://sco.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page"&gt;Scots Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, some years ago. At the time, I judged that the editors were treating Scots as a somewhat more dignified version of leet-speak, and put it from my mind. It &lt;a href="https://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/SummarySCO.htm"&gt;seems to have done better since&lt;/a&gt;, though it still has very few editors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the author, &lt;em&gt;Raik&lt;/em&gt; was inspired by &lt;em&gt;Depression Quest&lt;/em&gt;, which I have not yet played. I'd like to come back to this game after playing &lt;em&gt;Depression Quest&lt;/em&gt;, to see how it affects my opinion. At any rate, I foresee myself continuing to revisit and think about this game in the future, which is about the highest praise that can be given to a 'serious' game like this.&lt;/p&gt;

The first game, this year, is &lt;em&gt;Hill 160&lt;/em&gt; by Mike Gerwat, billed as "A World War I Adventure in Terror". This appears to be Gerwat's first comp entry, though he has released another game, &lt;em&gt;Genesis Quest&lt;/em&gt;, which is available &lt;a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/glulx/GenesisQuest.ulx"&gt;on the ifarchive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This post contains spoilers. Read at your own risk.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, this first game is one I couldn't finish. The author indicates that this game has been made easier to comply with the comp rules (the two-hour rule, I suppose), but I sincerely doubt that anyone will finish the game, because the walkthrough is a bit over 700 commands long. To complete the game you'd need to execute one (correct!) command every &lt;em&gt;ten seconds&lt;/em&gt;. Judging by the walkthrough, in 48 minutes I got through about a sixth of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the game were only too long, I would have continued to play for the full two hours games are allotted. Unfortunately, the game has three crippling flaws: first, it is tedious; second, it is unfriendly (more on this later); third, it is buggy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tedium is, I presume, intentional: it's intended to reflect the tedium of war. To that end, the game involves plenty of actions that are boring, repetitive, or both. The walkthrough contains (from about 700 turns) 57 turns of waiting, 19 turns of sleeping, and 16 turns of 'again', which are mostly sleeping or waiting. When you are acting, you are often doing something like &lt;strong&gt;drop pants / crap in trench / pull up pants&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unfriendliness is the main reason I gave up. Any little thing you do that isn't according to script will generally end the game. Leave the latrine without using it? "You didn't take your shite! GAME OVER MATEY!". Walk onto the battlefield without cleaning your rifle? "You didn't clean your rifle! GAME OVER MATEY!". Try to take the supplies you're after, rather than asking for them? "GAME OVER MATEY!".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not generally obvious what you're meant to do until you've already failed. How was I to know I had to clean the rifle? It's description didn't mention anything. For that matter, how was I to know I had to attach the bayonet myself? The game over message tells me that "Your rifle is missing a critical part.", but attempting to examine it again gives me "You've already examined the rifle.". The game won't let you examine anything twice, or talk to anyone twice. If you don't have a transcript, you'd better have remembered the names of the members of your platoon--you won't be seeing them again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not always obvious how to accomplish things, either. When you're sent for supplies, trying to simply take them from the supply party gets you killed, but &lt;strong&gt;talk to party&lt;/strong&gt; gives "You can't talk to the supply party." In fact, you must &lt;strong&gt;ask party for supplies&lt;/strong&gt;. But &lt;strong&gt;talk to grant&lt;/strong&gt; worked, earlier. The requirements are inconsistent. Once, when talking to Grant, you must salute (or game over!), but later, saluting isn't necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the game is buggy. If you talk to Grant in the Main Trench before going out on the recon mission, he gives the speech that he gave earlier about you needing to go pick up supplies. Waiting repeatedly will repeatedly give the text about Grant arriving. Sometimes waiting will just do nothing with no message at all. And it's not strictly a bug, but &lt;strong&gt;take all&lt;/strong&gt; should not open up every container and fill my inventory with several screens worth of cigarettes and grenades and things. It should just pick up the items I dropped. Very irritating!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that said, the game does have its good points. The author indicates that it's intended to be fairly realistic, based on his over 40 years of study, and there are plenty of interesting details. There are some detailed descriptions of certain items, and the language and situation are (apparently--the first World War is not my forte) also intended to be realistic. For my part, I'd enjoy it more simply exploring the environment than having the game nag at me about every minor detail (and the author promises that "When it goes up on the archive, it will be much harder with Release 2." Not necessary!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hill 160&lt;/em&gt; has potential, but I won't be returning to the current release.&lt;/p&gt;
