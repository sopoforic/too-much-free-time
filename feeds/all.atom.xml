Demaine, Alan Guo, and Giovanni Viglietta. The paper is originally from 2012, but it's been updated in February of this year with additional results. It's been mentioned a few times on the web, but I didn't see anyone give a satisfactory explanation of what the paper is really about. I'm not an expert, but I'll give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, though, the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We prove NP-hardness results for five of Nintendo's largest video game franchises: Mario, Donkey Kong, Legend of Zelda, Metroid, and Pokemon. Our results apply to Super Mario Bros. 1, 3, Lost Levels, and Super Mario World; Donkey Kong Country 1-3; all Legend of Zelda games except Zelda II: The Adventure of Link; all Metroid games; and all Pokemon role-playing games. For Mario and Donkey Kong, we show NP-completeness. In addition, we observe that several games in the Zelda series are PSPACE-complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does it all mean?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll go into some detail shortly, but I'd like to describe in broad strokes what this is (and isn't).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors look at how hard it is to answer the question: given a particular level layout, a starting point, and a finish point, is it possible to get from the start to the finish?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't about the levels actually in the games--in fact, it isn't really about the level design &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;. What it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; about is the rules of the games. &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt;, for example, has several well-known rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mushrooms make small Mario big.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Touching enemies (or some other hazards) makes big Mario small, or kills small Mario.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mario can break bricks only if he's big.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stars make Mario temporarily invulnerable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mario can jump to a height of 4 tiles, or 5 when running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more rules, but you see the point. Importantly, the authors specify that their results are about an &lt;em&gt;idealized&lt;/em&gt; version of the rules. In other words, glitches don't count. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the authors prove is that if you turn someone loose with a level editor, they can design a level for which it is very hard to determine whether it's even possible to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They do this by showing that you can implement a problem called the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem#3-satisfiability"&gt;3-satisfiability problem&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;3-SAT&lt;/em&gt;) in each of the games. Think of someone &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FoNJeYY-Oc"&gt;using redstone to make &lt;em&gt;Tetris&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and you've got the general idea. 3-SAT is known to be NP-complete (read as: difficult), and the game it's implemented in must be &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; as hard as 3-SAT. Those problems are called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hard"&gt;NP-hard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-satisfiability problem is to determine if, given a boolean formula of a certain form, it is possible to set the variables (which can be either true or false) in such a way that the whole formula comes out true. A two-variable example of 3-SAT might be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;(y is TRUE | x is TRUE | x is TRUE)
    AND
(x is FALSE | y is TRUE | y is TRUE)
    AND
(x is FALSE | y is FALSE | y is FALSE)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Don't be alarmed by the duplication. The reason for writing that way will be apparent later.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;3&lt;/em&gt; in 3-SAT means that each sub-expression (in parentheses) can have at most 3 parts. In this case, each has only two parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three sub-expressions must be true for the formula to be true, and a sub-expression is true if &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of its components (which are separated by pipes) is true. In logic-speak, it's a conjunction of several disjunctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's pretty easy to see that this expression is true if y is true (satisfying the first part) and x is false (satisfying the other two). But, what if there were fifty or a hundred or a billion sub-expressions? That would be harder to tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Requirements for 3-SAT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be able to implement 3-SAT, you need a few components. You need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A starting point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A finishing point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A way to pick whether a variable is true or false&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A way for those choices to either impede or allow progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A way to let paths cross without being able to change from one path to another&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last one is so that you can build big, complex paths. Without it, you'd be able to backtrack and mess things up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors implement these components in 'gadgets', which are basically self-contained rooms or screens that can be connected to each other. They're the building blocks of the satisfiability puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gadgets in &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll take a brief look at how the authors build these gadgets for &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt;, as an example. This is going to be pretty much the same as what the authors say in the paper, so if you're feeling industrious, you can look at the paper and see how they put it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Start&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The start gadget is just where Mario starts the level--there's nothing to it. In general, the authors want Mario to be big throughout the level, so they put a mushroom at the beginning that will be required at the finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Finish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this is trivial. It's just the flagpole. To make sure Mario stayed big throughout the level, you have him enter the screen with the flagpole in a corridor with a brick he must break to reach the flagpole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Finish gadget" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/aloupis2012-mario1-finish-gadget.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Variable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To pick whether a variable is true or false, Mario is given a screen with two possible paths--a vertical drop to either the left or right. Say left means "x is true" and right means "x is false". It doesn't matter which. The drops are long enough that Mario can't get back up, so once a choice is made, Mario can't go back and also take the other path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Clause and Check&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the most interesting (and important) gadget in &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; Take a look at it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Clause and Check gadget" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/aloupis2012-mario1-clause-gadget.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making a choice and dropping from the Variable gadget, Mario will be led to (a series of) Clause gadgets. He enters one of the small open areas from the bottom--each one of them will have a path from a Variable gadget that leads to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each block contains a star, which will be trapped in the 'fence' when Mario hits the block. Later, Mario will come through the top part (that's the Check part of the gadget) and collect the star so that he can run through the Firebars. If Mario gets to the Check gadget without having hit the star block (thus satisfying the disjunction), he can't proceed--the Firebars will kill him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember our example of 3-SAT from earlier?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;(y is TRUE | x is TRUE | x is TRUE)
    AND
(x is FALSE | y is TRUE | y is TRUE)
    AND
(x is FALSE | y is FALSE | y is FALSE)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Imagine that the gadget pictured corresponds to the top disjunction, &lt;code&gt;(y is TRUE | x is TRUE | x is TRUE)&lt;/code&gt;. Then Mario will reach the left star block if he picked "y is TRUE" by dropping down the left side of the corresponding Variable gadget, and the middle and right star blocks by picking "x is TRUE" by dropping down the left side of &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; particular Variable gadget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if Mario picked "x is false" and "y is false"? Then he'd never get to the blocks and release the star, so when he got to the Check gadget, the Firebars would kill him. That means that both variables being false isn't a solution to the expression, and (equivalently) taking the right path at both variable gadgets won't let Mario finish the level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Crossover&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a utility to let paths cross without Mario backtracking and making two different choices for one Variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Crossover gadget" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/aloupis2012-mario1-crossover-gadget.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Mario comes in from the lower path, he can break the bricks and keep going up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he comes in from the upper path, he can run into the Goomba to become small, head to the right, pick up the mushroom from the block, break the brick, and continue to the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small Mario can't break the bricks in the middle to go up, and big Mario can't get through the narrow paths to go to the right. Big Mario also can't break the bricks and then go back, because the drop on the left is too far for him to get back up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Putting it all together&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can string together as many Variable, Clause, and Check gadgets as you need to make as big of a problem as you want. Since we know that 3-SAT is NP-complete, and we've just implemented 3-SAT in &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt;, we know that &lt;em&gt;SMB&lt;/em&gt; is NP-hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! If you've made it this far, then you've got the major idea of (part of) the paper. Pick up your CS degree on the way out the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other games, other problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't go into detail about the other sections of the paper, but if you've read this far, you should be able to read the paper and see what is being done. The proofs for other Mario games just make some modifications to the gadgets we looked at above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proofs for the Zelda games are different. They still work by implementing an NP-hard problem, but it's a different problem, and they implement it using the sliding blocks in the Zelda series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know about the other games, or get more details, take look at the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Caveat lector&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've done my best, here, but I'm not an expert. I've got a BS in math, not a doctorate in computer science. If I've made some terrible mistake, it's all my fault (and I'd appreciate it if you'd let me know!), and I apologize for anything misleading, confusing, or dangerous that I've written. Always wear proper safety equipment when proving theorems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I saw a new game from &lt;a href="http://www.zachtronics.com/"&gt;Zachtronics Industries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;TIS-100&lt;/em&gt;, which was released &lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/370360/"&gt;on Steam&lt;/a&gt; as an early access title on the first of June. In some ways, calling it a game is overstating it: it's little more than a collection of programming problems, with a little story to give it some structure. The catch is that you're programming in an assembly language on a virtual machine with unusual architecture; problems beyond the simplest will generally require you to take advantage of parallelism (which is the primary distinguishing feature of the VM), resulting in novel solutions for ordinary problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TIS-100 game screen" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/370360_2015-06-17_00005.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, a game like that has a rather limited target audience. Case in point: I have myself previously created a little VM with a fake assembly language to play with. The game is clearly made just for me, but how many others are likely to be similarly interested? About 11,000,&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; so far. It's a minor hit.&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of programming as gameplay isn't new. Indeed, Zachtronics's earlier game, &lt;em&gt;SpaceChem&lt;/em&gt;, is also an exercise in parallel programming, though dressed up in fancier clothes. Way back in the mists of time,&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;em&gt;Robot Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; challenged players to program the titular robots to solve puzzles. And on the more-programming-than-game end of the spectrum, we have &lt;em&gt;Core War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and a multitude of web sites in the vein of &lt;a href="https://projecteuler.net/"&gt;Project Euler&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.codingame.com/home"&gt;CodinGame&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been enjoying &lt;em&gt;TIS-100&lt;/em&gt;, but more than that, I think it's singularly impressive to release a game of this kind. Certainly, there are games that trade on their difficulty (&lt;em&gt;Super Hexagon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;I Wanna Be the Guy&lt;/em&gt;, etc.) and some that take pride in their difficulty of interaction (&lt;em&gt;Surgeon Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ampu-Tea&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;QWOP&lt;/em&gt;, etc.), and simple 'retro-style' graphics are &lt;em&gt;de rigueur&lt;/em&gt; for indie games, but the very minimalistic functionalism of &lt;em&gt;TIS-100&lt;/em&gt; is astounding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TIS-100&lt;/em&gt; is difficult because the thinking required to solve the puzzles is difficult. It is perhaps inaccessible, because it consists of nothing else &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; the tools to solve the puzzle. Its graphics are simple because everything you need to solve the puzzles is a text-mode interactive debugger, and that's what you get. Like a sudoku puzzle or a crossword, &lt;em&gt;TIS-100&lt;/em&gt; is a completely pure puzzle game: the game takes place in your head, and the software keeps score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not by chance that &lt;em&gt;TIS-100&lt;/em&gt; so distinguishes itself from other games. During the production of &lt;em&gt;Infinifactory&lt;/em&gt;, Zach Barth, the founder of Zachtronics, wanted to make a game with a smaller team--something more-indie-than-indie--to get back to his roots as an indie developer. The project turned out to be too great in scope, but from its wreckage was salvaged a programming minigame which became &lt;em&gt;TIS-100&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Viewed as an indie developer's attempt to make something &lt;em&gt;even more indie&lt;/em&gt;, with the understanding that it was a small part of something larger, the design makes sense.&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game's manual, too, reflects the niche targeted by the game. Who reads a manual, you ask? When it is positioned as a technical document describing the instruction set of a virtual machine, the answer to that question is: programmers. The manual is presented as the in-universe manual for the TIS-100 computer, previously the property of the player character's Uncle Randy, including handwritten notes and highlighting. This was part of Zachtronics's attempt to make a game with "an irresistible value proposition. For us, that's a game with a 14-page technical manual that we designed, printed out, marked up and scanned back in again."&lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The manual is reminiscent of the feelies accompanying Infocom games, among others, in years past.&lt;sup id="fnref:8"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TIS-100 results screen" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/370360_2015-06-18_00001.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like its predecessor, &lt;em&gt;SpaceChem&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;TIS-100&lt;/em&gt; encourages players to perfect their solutions, optimizing for either execution speed, least number of nodes used, or least instructions--goals which are often contradictory, requiring multiple solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, given that it is a game about programming, the players of &lt;em&gt;TIS-100&lt;/em&gt; have created some auxiliary tools, including &lt;a href="http://www.tis100pad.com/"&gt;TIS-100 PAD&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;sup id="fnref:9"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which allows users to more easily share solutions, and a variety of TIS-100 (the virtual machine, not the game) emulators.&lt;sup id="fnref:10"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to this unsolicited community participation, with the release of the specification editor, which allows players to make their own puzzles, a puzzle design contest was announced. Twenty-five puzzles will be selected from the submissions for an official bonus campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feel of &lt;em&gt;TIS-100&lt;/em&gt; is both nostalgic and quite modern. It's an intriguing combination, and I recommend it to anyone still interested after hearing me call it "a collection of programming problems." Coders, no prior experience with assembly is needed. Others, if you like this game--try coding. You'll probably like that, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The details of &lt;em&gt;TIS-100&lt;/em&gt;'s inception, and more, are discussed in an interview published by Gamasutra, [Wawro2015].&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Barth wrote in a post mortem of &lt;em&gt;SpaceChem&lt;/em&gt;, [Barth2012], that &lt;em&gt;SpaceChem&lt;/em&gt; was too difficult and inaccessible. New titles were forthcoming: "New titles, I might add, that are hopefully more accessible than &lt;em&gt;SpaceChem&lt;/em&gt;!"&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:6" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But I am writing about a good game, at least: &lt;em&gt;Bleed Out Sakuretsu&lt;/em&gt;, a vertically scrolling shooter for the Sharp X68000, by Gold Cats Project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bleed Out Sakuretsu title screen" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Bleed-Out-Sakuretsu-title.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First: yes, the title screen says 'sakuretu'. But the common romanization of this game's title seems to be 'sakuretsu', and as goes TOSEC, so goes my nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="In-game" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Bleed-Out-Sakuretsu-ingame.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleed Out Sakuretsu&lt;/em&gt; has a powerup system reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;Gradius&lt;/em&gt;. As you continue scoring points, you can purchase a shot upgrade, a barrier, or other, even more powerful powerups. The opposition is a variety of ships, small shots, and guided missiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Boss fight" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Bleed-Out-Sakuretsu-boss.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boss sprays out bullets danmaku-style, and periodically fires a pair of front-facing lasers. You've got to deal with this while avoiding guided missiles, and since you are destroyed in one shot (unless you buy a barrier), this, like the rest of the level, provides a good challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, an unfortunate revelation: the boss is, as far as I can tell, invulnerable, because the available version of &lt;em&gt;Bleed Out Sakuretsu&lt;/em&gt; is a trial edition, and I can find no evidence that any full version was ever created. I would love to hear otherwise, if anyone has better information on old doujin games than I do, because it's a very fun game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMZdr6LtHT8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to do a shooter justice with just words and screenshots. The video above shows (I believe) the entire game, which should give a much better picture of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like shooters, I'd say &lt;em&gt;Bleed Out Sakuretsu&lt;/em&gt; is worth a try. It's only about two minutes long, but it's fun, and I believe there's a place for brief games, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Touhou&lt;/em&gt; series looms largest on the doujin shooter landscape, of course, but there's a huge and fascinating variety of games (of all genres) stretching back decades, which I think could use some more attention from the English-speaking web. I'll probably be looking at a few more doujin games in coming weeks, so I'll try to shine a light on whichever titles catch my eye. Maybe there will be some hidden gems, or maybe just hidden failures. We'll see what comes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="doujin shooter"></category><category term="Gold Cats Project"></category><category term="not on mobygames"></category><category term="vaporware"></category><category term="1996"></category><category term="x68000"></category><category term="vertical scrolling shooter"></category><category term="good"></category></entry><entry><title>History Mystery</title><link href="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/history-mystery.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-06-19T13:47:29-04:00</updated><author><name>Tracy Poff</name></author><id>tag:sopoforic.github.io,2015-03-12:too-much-free-time/history-mystery.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the early eighties, the sudden popularity (and, indeed, the recent &lt;em&gt;existence&lt;/em&gt;) of home computers gave rise to a new kind of publication: the disk magazine. These periodicals were published not on paper but on computer disks (and sometimes cassettes), and although the content varied, they generally featured computer programs (including games) in addition to, or even in place of, articles. The most famous of these are perhaps &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softdisk_(disk_magazine)"&gt;Softdisk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for the Apple II (launched in 1981) and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loadstar"&gt;Loadstar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for the Commodore 64 (launched in 1984). The medium flourished&lt;sup id="fnref:diskmags"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:diskmags" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; alongside more traditional magazines which might offer (inconvenient!) type-in programs. There was a price to be paid for this convenience: a single 'issue' of &lt;em&gt;Softdisk&lt;/em&gt; cost about the same as an annual subscription to a paper magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the many disk mags was Scholastic's &lt;em&gt;Microzine&lt;/em&gt; for Apple II. Featuring (as you might expect) primarily educational content, &lt;em&gt;Microzine&lt;/em&gt; began publication in 1983,&lt;sup id="fnref:micropub"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:micropub" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; continuing for about a decade. It also inspired a spin-off series, &lt;em&gt;Microzine Jr.&lt;/em&gt;, which was launched in 1988. Each issue of &lt;em&gt;Microzine&lt;/em&gt; included four programs, one of which was a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="History Mystery title screen" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Microzine18.Sid_000000004.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which all brings me to the subject of this article: &lt;em&gt;History Mystery&lt;/em&gt; by David A. Bowman and &lt;a href="http://www.highcastle.com/MarkHome/mark.htm"&gt;Mark A. Malamud&lt;/a&gt;, which was included in &lt;em&gt;Microzine&lt;/em&gt; #18 in November 1986. According to the '&lt;a href="https://tmft.wordpress.com/?attachment_id=945"&gt;Letter from the Editor&lt;/a&gt;' in that issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll have fun reading &lt;strong&gt;The History Mystery&lt;/strong&gt; Twistaplot™ adventure. A priceless hourglass has been stolen from the Microville History Museum. Some of the ghosts in the museum will help you find it. (Yes, the museum is haunted!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You play the part of "the ace reporter of your school newspaper, &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;The Chronicle&lt;/span&gt;" (incidentally, &lt;a href="https://tmft.wordpress.com/?attachment_id=953"&gt;of selectable gender&lt;/a&gt;), out to get a story about a stolen Babylonian hourglass. After chatting with the ghost of Mark Twain about the situation, you find yourself in the lobby of the museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Museum lobby" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Microzine18.Sid_000000014.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The museum consists of 29 rooms&lt;sup id="fnref:map"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:map" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which you must navigate, gathering items and clues to solve the mystery of the stolen hourglass, which the museum's ghosts believe is actually located within the museum. Each room has a description, seen on entering the room, and an entry in the self-guided tape-recorded tour, accessed by pressing &lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;. The tour often contained educational information&lt;sup id="fnref:tour"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:tour" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which might be used to solve the game's puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Age of Dinosaurs room" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Microzine18.Sid_000000019.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some rooms have items to be collected, while others have ghosts to talk to or other objects to interact with. The game is in two parts (purely for practical reasons, I presume). Selecting the second part from the menu requires the player to input the password given at the end of the first part ("The Sands of Time") and begins the second part, in which the player must collect the hourglass and escape the museum while being chased by Winsome Slugg, the criminal who had stolen it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tracy's Gift Shop" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/tracys-gift-shop.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon completing the game, the player gets a rather neat reward: the museum's gift shop, called "Amy Minkley's Gift Shop",&lt;sup id="fnref:giftshop"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:giftshop" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; will be renamed after the player. Not only in the ending text, either: in future playthroughs, the in-game name is changed. Which, I suppose, might make this the first game with a New Game+ feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;History Mystery&lt;/em&gt; took me about an hour to complete, though I suppose it took me quite a bit longer when I was a child. I remember having a lot of fun with it, back then, and it's still neat as a bit of nostalgia, today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tales of Suspense" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/tales-of-suspense.jpg" /&gt;
My copy of the game is this 1987 compilation, &lt;em&gt;Tales of Suspense&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll try to look at some more games from &lt;em&gt;Microzine&lt;/em&gt; and other disk mags in the future. There's a lot to be said about them, and the resources on the internet are scarce at best. This post has been several years in the making, during which time I've been contacted a number of times by people who, like me, had fond memories of a game which &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; have been &lt;em&gt;History Mystery&lt;/em&gt;, but who couldn't be sure. My thanks to them for providing me the impetus to do my civic duty and get this out there. Fans of old educational games, you are appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

Ferguson&lt;/a&gt;, to be published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Communication&lt;/em&gt;, which argues that the common belief that there is a positive correlation between media violence and societal violence is false. The abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article presents 2 studies of the association of media violence rates with societal violence rates. In the first study, movie violence and homicide rates are examined across the 20th century and into the 21st (1920–2005). Throughout the mid-20th century small-to-moderate correlational relationships can be observed between movie violence and homicide rates in the United States. This trend reversed in the early and latter 20th century, with movie violence rates inversely related to homicide rates. In the second study, videogame violence consumption is examined against youth violence rates in the previous 2 decades. Videogame consumption is associated with a decline in youth violence rates. Results suggest that societal consumption of media violence is not predictive of increased societal violence rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The article, briefly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the full article is about twenty pages, I'll summarize it here, with a bit more detail than the abstract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferguson begins by establishing that there is not general agreement in the literature as to correlation (much less causation) between media violence and societal violence. He particularly argues that that laboratory studies which show an increase in aggression (e.g. an increased tendency to fill in missing letters in words to create violent words) following consumption of violent media may not correspond to increased societal violence (e.g. homicide).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first study analyzes the relationship between violence in movies and homicide, between 1920 and 2005. To assess violence in movies, the top five grossing movies per year were taken at five-year intervals, and graded for violent content. This data was compared to statistics for murder and (non-negligent) homicide during the same years. Ferguson concludes that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together these data suggest that perceived correlations between movie and societal violence were associated with a chance concordance during the mid-20th century. Given that these phenomena were not in concordance in either the early or latter 20th century, it appears that efforts to establish causal connections between movie and societal violence based on a select set of decades were an ecological fallacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second study analyzes the relationship between violence in video games and youth violence for the years 1996 to 2011. Ferguson uses sales data from IMDb and the ESA and takes the ratings assigned by the ESRB as a proxy for violent content. He concludes that there is a "remarkably strong" inverse relationship between violent video game consumption and youth violence and that, although this is no indication of causality, "Evidence from societal data does not support claims of dramatic videogame violence effects on violence among youth."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Ferguson argues that alternate methods should be used in the future when assessing the effect of media consumption on behavior, and that professional organizations such as the APA should "retire their policy statements on media violence as such statements tend to be misleading and may cause more harm than good." Furthermore, "Arguably, given that the results from the effects paradigm have been weak and inconsistent, it may be time for scholars to make less rather than more conclusive statements to news media regarding media effects on society."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unaddressed questions and other problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferguson's conclusion in the first study (namely that positive correlation between media violence and societal violence is limited to a mid-century concordance) seems undeniable. I am not similarly satisfied with the second study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious problem with the second study is that it addresses a period of only sixteen years, and in particular that it does not even consider whether the change in rate of youth violence differed before and after the introduction of video games. Given that Ferguson strongly criticized reliance on data from a limited time span in the first study, this is fairly damning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the second study does not argue that &lt;em&gt;generally&lt;/em&gt; increased video game consumption corresponds to an increase in the consumption of &lt;em&gt;violent&lt;/em&gt; video games &lt;em&gt;by youths&lt;/em&gt;. I freely admit that it is likely that this is true, but the study makes no mention of it. In general, I am not convinced by Ferguson's 'just look at the top five games according to IMDb' approach to analyzing the state of gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, the study blithely dismisses any correlation between increased incarceration and decreased youth violence, on strength of &lt;a href="http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ875143"&gt;a paper by Stahlkopf, Males, and Macallair&lt;/a&gt;. Based on its abstract, that paper only concludes that increased &lt;em&gt;juvenile&lt;/em&gt; incarceration does not lead to reduced crime (specifically in California). It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible that the full paper has more useful (for Ferguson) conclusions, but I do not have access to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, the graphs in the paper are unclear as to what exactly is depicted. Figure 3, "Societal videogame violence consumption and societal youth violence, 1996-2011.", is a double chart with yearly figures for the two measures in question, with scales ranging from 0-9000 for one and 0-40 for the other. 9000 what? 40 what? I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifth, without commenting on the sensibility of the suggestions Ferguson makes, I would say that his statements in the "Theoretical implications" section are not supported by the studies. Ferguson argues that different theoretical approaches should be used in studying the relationship between media violence and societal violence, essentially by mentioning a variety of alternatives without arguing for their particular effectiveness. Such arguments would be better suited to a paper which actually considers the relative merit of the various approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixth, the "Policy implications" section reads like a conspiracy theory. Selections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a matter of policy, consistent with the statement by the Consortium of Scholars (2013)...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...media-based policy statements released by professional organizations have so often been revealed to be flawed (e.g., Ferguson, 2013;Magid, 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...it has been revealed that past policy statements were typically
developed by specially selected researchers heavily invested in antimedia views, with no dissenting voices (Ferguson, 2013).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, problems have been 'revealed' &lt;em&gt;by the author of this paper&lt;/em&gt;. The 'statement by the Consortium of Scholars' mentioned is an open letter of which Ferguson is a signatory, and the source of which is &lt;em&gt;Ferguson's personal website&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id="fnref:homepage"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:homepage" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reference to Magid links to a paper published in &lt;em&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt; (by O'Keeffe and Clarke-Pearson), but the actual reference listed is to an article in &lt;em&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt; which responds to (and disputes) the journal article. Why Ferguson would obfuscatingly link to the article in &lt;em&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt; rather than the one in &lt;em&gt;HuffPo&lt;/em&gt; to which he actually referred is a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, take note of "...some scholars have argued...(Males, 2013)." That reference is not to a scholarly paper, but what seems to be simply an opinion piece published by YouthFacts.org.&lt;sup id="fnref:broken"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:broken" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the actual studies in the paper seem fairly inoffensive, but do not support the discussion. It seems very like Ferguson wanted to pontificate about perceived problems in his field, and conducted a couple of very minor studies in order to have an excuse for publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Caveats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I have not studied psychology. I studied math at uni, so except insofar as the paper uses statistical analyses, I have no formal education relevant to this paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, as I do not have access to a university library, I have not been able to review all of the paper's references. It is possible that some or all of my objections were answered by the cited papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, I am (obviously) a gamer, and inclined to agree with the &lt;em&gt;results&lt;/em&gt; of the studies in this paper, despite my objections to the academic rigour of the paper. It is possible that I have been too lenient with the studies for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;

Georgiou. You play Sandy, a woman who is trying to discover the name of the man she just spent the night with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One pre-spoiler note: the download from the comp website just has an HTML file with a link to a web-based version of the game, but the story file &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be downloaded, if you follow that link. You'll need a Quest interpreter to play it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This post contains spoilers. Read at your own risk.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a note about online play: the online interpreter was rather slow to react, occasionally taking many seconds to complete a command, and usually missing the first few characters of each command I typed, since it was still scrolling the response text. This was irritating, but it otherwise worked fine, and it was at least visually attractive. Not ideal, but better than nothing, given that I don't actually have a Quest interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ONS&lt;/em&gt; is a short comedy game with one puzzle sequence. I spent about 35 minutes prodding everything in the game before I finished, but I imagine 10 minutes would more than suffice, if you just proceed toward the goal--and particularly if you aren't using the rather slow web-based interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate the customized responses to trying to take various objects, and the randomly chosen sections of text (e.g. when knocking on Mara's door) are a nice touch. The ending, though not &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; unexpected, is a good enough payoff for the few minutes the game takes to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, you don't have any real options--either you proceed linearly through the story, or you don't proceed at all. I wanted to try tricking the dude into saying his name. To break down in tears to avoid the situation. To call him Rumpelstiltskin, if his name is so important. Anything to have some choice--but I had none. More mundanely, there are few objects implemented, and no real, interactive NPCs. The parser is a little obtuse, too: you've got to &lt;strong&gt;knock door&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;use bottle on floor&lt;/strong&gt;, which aren't exactly the first commands that came to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, an average-quality game, which would probably be more at home in the first ifcomp than the twentieth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Post-review pre-posting note&lt;/em&gt;: Okay, I think this review needs an addendum. Other reviewers seem to be unanimous in despising this game. It was my assumption throughout the game that it was a work of parody--the several-inches deep layer of grease on the kitchen floor not a greater exaggeration than the PC's absurd internal monologue. &lt;em&gt;Surely&lt;/em&gt; the game is so stupid exactly because it's undermining its nominal position. Of course, while writing the review, I was under the impression that the author was a woman (Wrong! Giannis is a Greek name which is the masculine form Gianna. The more you know.), and that therefore the PC &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be a parody of the ridiculous caricatures of women we see in games and other media (maybe not?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's against my policy to change my judgment after reading other reviews, so I'll let this review stand as-is. I'd rather be too generous in my assumptions about other people than too harsh. In retrospect, though, if you take seriously the bits that I assumed to be failed comedy, then the game really &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; become rather unpalatable... so take this review with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="female protagonist"></category><category term="ifcomp 2014"></category><category term="2014"></category><category term="freeware"></category><category term="interactive fiction"></category><category term="platform independent"></category><category term="Giannis G.

According to the blurb, it is "A scots fantasia about anxiety. Battle kelpies, watch TV, avoid your emails and find the magical Staff of the Salmon." Sounds amusing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This post contains spoilers. Read at your own risk.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My spoiler warning above goes double for this game. Really definitely don't read this without playing the game. I mean it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you start the game, you're advised that you can "Learn about Scots and use a translator at &lt;a href="http://www.scots-online.org/"&gt;Scots-Online.org&lt;/a&gt;", and you are presented with a pair of links: &lt;strong&gt;gang&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;go&lt;/strong&gt;. It looks from the outset as if the game is simply available in two languages--Scots and English--for flavor, and the "Translate to Scots" and "Translate to English" links that appear reinforce this. The text is even very similar in shape in each language. However, this is only a facade: there are two stories being told, and they are superficially unrelated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Scots-language story, the PC struggles through the day, trying to fill time: "If ye can get tae hauf five, mebbe ye can get tae dinner, than mebbe ye can get tae bed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the English-language story, the PC is on an epic quest: "You are searching for the Staff of the Salmon, whose magic alone will release your clan from the withering curse of Black Edward."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of each page of text is an option to 'translate' into the other language, which actually presents not a translation but the section of the story which is in the corresponding position in the other language: the stories are structurally the same. They are related in more ways that one: at the end of the English-language story, "You imagine another version of yourself, who stayed in bed that fateful day and even now lies frozen in time, unable to act, an endless scream seeking only relief." In the most recent corresponding part of the Scots-language story, the PC is paralyzed by a panic attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My interpretation: the Scots-language story is 'real', and the English-language story is the PC's way of dealing with life--or of &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; dealing with life, as the case may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The duality of the stories is very cool and well done. Though you could (mostly) play them separately, the English-language story serves as commentary on the Scots-language story. For example, when the PC of the Scots-language story is (figuratively) lost in a panic attack, the PC of the English-language story is (literally) lost in a maze. It's an impressive way to use metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The individual stories are well-crafted, too. I particularly liked the use of links to pace the story. Early on, links interrupting the text make the story seem to move slower, but later they make the pacing seem more frantic--well done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll note that my praise is all for 'meta' aspects of the game--this is not an accident. The &lt;em&gt;actual game&lt;/em&gt; isn't all that interesting. The Scots-language story is dull (but it's &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be, since it's the 'real-world' part of the game) and the English-language story is far from engaging. However, the game is quite short (about fifteen minutes for a single playthrough), so this wasn't a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language aspect could prove something of a problem. It's easy enough to tell the general sense of the Scots-language story, but for most readers there will be &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; specific terms that require definition. It's certainly the author's intention to induce readers to learn more about Scots, which is fine, though I wonder how much effort the (non-comp-judging) general public will be willing to expend on comprehension. My own experience with Scots (other than &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_a_Mouse"&gt;Robert Burns&lt;/a&gt;) is limited to an encounter with the &lt;a href="https://sco.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page"&gt;Scots Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, some years ago. At the time, I judged that the editors were treating Scots as a somewhat more dignified version of leet-speak, and put it from my mind. It &lt;a href="https://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/SummarySCO.htm"&gt;seems to have done better since&lt;/a&gt;, though it still has very few editors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the author, &lt;em&gt;Raik&lt;/em&gt; was inspired by &lt;em&gt;Depression Quest&lt;/em&gt;, which I have not yet played. I'd like to come back to this game after playing &lt;em&gt;Depression Quest&lt;/em&gt;, to see how it affects my opinion. At any rate, I foresee myself continuing to revisit and think about this game in the future, which is about the highest praise that can be given to a 'serious' game like this.&lt;/p&gt;

The first game, this year, is &lt;em&gt;Hill 160&lt;/em&gt; by Mike Gerwat, billed as "A World War I Adventure in Terror". This appears to be Gerwat's first comp entry, though he has released another game, &lt;em&gt;Genesis Quest&lt;/em&gt;, which is available &lt;a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/glulx/GenesisQuest.ulx"&gt;on the ifarchive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This post contains spoilers. Read at your own risk.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, this first game is one I couldn't finish. The author indicates that this game has been made easier to comply with the comp rules (the two-hour rule, I suppose), but I sincerely doubt that anyone will finish the game, because the walkthrough is a bit over 700 commands long. To complete the game you'd need to execute one (correct!) command every &lt;em&gt;ten seconds&lt;/em&gt;. Judging by the walkthrough, in 48 minutes I got through about a sixth of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the game were only too long, I would have continued to play for the full two hours games are allotted. Unfortunately, the game has three crippling flaws: first, it is tedious; second, it is unfriendly (more on this later); third, it is buggy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tedium is, I presume, intentional: it's intended to reflect the tedium of war. To that end, the game involves plenty of actions that are boring, repetitive, or both. The walkthrough contains (from about 700 turns) 57 turns of waiting, 19 turns of sleeping, and 16 turns of 'again', which are mostly sleeping or waiting. When you are acting, you are often doing something like &lt;strong&gt;drop pants / crap in trench / pull up pants&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unfriendliness is the main reason I gave up. Any little thing you do that isn't according to script will generally end the game. Leave the latrine without using it? "You didn't take your shite! GAME OVER MATEY!". Walk onto the battlefield without cleaning your rifle? "You didn't clean your rifle! GAME OVER MATEY!". Try to take the supplies you're after, rather than asking for them? "GAME OVER MATEY!".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not generally obvious what you're meant to do until you've already failed. How was I to know I had to clean the rifle? It's description didn't mention anything. For that matter, how was I to know I had to attach the bayonet myself? The game over message tells me that "Your rifle is missing a critical part.", but attempting to examine it again gives me "You've already examined the rifle.". The game won't let you examine anything twice, or talk to anyone twice. If you don't have a transcript, you'd better have remembered the names of the members of your platoon--you won't be seeing them again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not always obvious how to accomplish things, either. When you're sent for supplies, trying to simply take them from the supply party gets you killed, but &lt;strong&gt;talk to party&lt;/strong&gt; gives "You can't talk to the supply party." In fact, you must &lt;strong&gt;ask party for supplies&lt;/strong&gt;. But &lt;strong&gt;talk to grant&lt;/strong&gt; worked, earlier. The requirements are inconsistent. Once, when talking to Grant, you must salute (or game over!), but later, saluting isn't necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the game is buggy. If you talk to Grant in the Main Trench before going out on the recon mission, he gives the speech that he gave earlier about you needing to go pick up supplies. Waiting repeatedly will repeatedly give the text about Grant arriving. Sometimes waiting will just do nothing with no message at all. And it's not strictly a bug, but &lt;strong&gt;take all&lt;/strong&gt; should not open up every container and fill my inventory with several screens worth of cigarettes and grenades and things. It should just pick up the items I dropped. Very irritating!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that said, the game does have its good points. The author indicates that it's intended to be fairly realistic, based on his over 40 years of study, and there are plenty of interesting details. There are some detailed descriptions of certain items, and the language and situation are (apparently--the first World War is not my forte) also intended to be realistic. For my part, I'd enjoy it more simply exploring the environment than having the game nag at me about every minor detail (and the author promises that "When it goes up on the archive, it will be much harder with Release 2." Not necessary!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hill 160&lt;/em&gt; has potential, but I won't be returning to the current release.&lt;/p&gt;

A power outage caused me to lose my carefully prepared sample document, so while I recover from the pain of loss, let's take a look at something different: packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, a lot of software is distributed digitally, and even software distributed on disk is often packaged in no more than a keep case, but it used to be that when you bought a piece of software, you really got your money's worth. Boxes, manuals, stacks of disks--you could measure software by the pound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tmft.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/pict0057.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-919" src="https://tmft.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/pict0057.jpg?w=300" alt="DCIM100MEDIA" width="300" height="225" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Item number one: an upgrade kit for OS/2 2.0. I've scanned the &lt;a href="https://tmft.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/os2front.jpg"&gt;front&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://tmft.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/os2back.jpg"&gt;back&lt;/a&gt;, if you'd like a better look. It's a fairly unassuming little box, but inside...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tmft.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/pict0059.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-922" src="https://tmft.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/pict0059.jpg?w=300" alt="DCIM100MEDIA" width="300" height="225" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; different manuals ("Migrating to the OS/2 Workplace Shell", "Getting Started", "Using the Operating System", and "Installation Guide"), a pile of legal documentation, a rather shiny proof of license, &lt;em&gt;twenty-one&lt;/em&gt; 3.5" diskettes, and, to top it off, a roll of stickers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tmft.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/wpwin.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-923" src="https://tmft.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/wpwin.jpg?w=261" alt="wpwin" width="261" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My copy of WordPerfect 5.2 for Windows came with a &lt;a href="https://tmft.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/wpcatalog.jpg"&gt;catalog&lt;/a&gt; (Issue 4--collect them all, I suppose) full of ancillary material, including fonts and instructional videos, a heavy cardboard folder containing a &lt;a href="https://tmft.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/wplicense.jpg"&gt;license certificate&lt;/a&gt;, and, most importantly, one of these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tmft.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/wpoverlay.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-926 size-large" src="https://tmft.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/wpoverlay.jpg?w=1024" alt="wpoverlay" width="1024" height="121" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plastic keyboard overlay! Once, keyboards had room above the function keys for one of these, and for complex software, they were very necessary, at least until you got used to the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tmft.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/wpmini.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-927" src="https://tmft.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/wpmini.jpg?w=264" alt="wpmini" width="264" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you didn't always need a hefty manual--particularly if you already owned one. This 'additional license' version of WordPerfect 5.1 (suggested retail price: $295 US) contains a license certificate, a keyboard overlay, and not much else. From the back of the box:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Additional License Package is sold to you based on your certification that you are an authorized and licensed user of this version of this WordPerfect Corporation ("WPCorp") software product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This package includes a license and templates, but does not include manuals of disks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full-size software box for basically just a piece of paper. Dead tree edition, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Nihongo Word Processor v1.10</title><link href="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/nihongo-word-processor-v110.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-06-19T16:59:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Tracy Poff</name></author><id>tag:sopoforic.github.io,2014-09-20:too-much-free-time/nihongo-word-processor-v110.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The second X68k word processor I'll look at is the "SHARP X68000 日本語ワードプロセッサ Ver 1.10", produced circa 1990 by Sharp itself. It is credited with programming by H. Nakamoto and management by H. Tanaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Nihongo Word Processor v1.10" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/nihongo-word-processor-v1-10.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For being only about two years newer, Sharp's Nihongo Word Processor (henceforth, NWP) looks &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; nicer than &lt;a href="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/ew.html"&gt;EW&lt;/a&gt;. Its interface reminds me very much of classic Macintosh programs. Coincidentally, the Mac also used a Motorola 68000 CPU, though somehow I doubt it influenced interface design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides being pretty, NWP is a perfectly serviceable word processor, with the standard features, plus one very neat divergence from the norm: on the right side of the screen is a pinboard with two notes attached to it. These represent the dual clipboard arrangement NWP uses. The left clipboard holds text which has been cut, and the right text which has been copied. There are separate paste commands for each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a minor thing, perhaps, but it's exactly the kind of uniqueness that makes me interested in software from this era. At this time, the clipboard functionality was provided by each program individually, rather than by the operating system (and its associated standard libraries), so the implementation is a conscious choice by the developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you look further back in software history, you can see different interface paradigms contending against one another for mindshare, each representing a different developer's idea about how the interface ought to be.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="EW" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/ew.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This word processor is identified as "X68000 Word Processor &amp;lt;&amp;lt; EW &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Version 1.20O", a 1988 release by EAST Co., Ltd. (which company &lt;a href="http://www.est.co.jp/"&gt;still exists&lt;/a&gt;, by the way).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EW looks quite similar to other word processors from the eighties: simply and ugly, including the (inexplicable!) choice to display hard returns on screen. Its ruler also measures not the size of the text on the page, but the number of columns occupied by the text. Fully 96 (half-width) columns are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You interact with the program's extended features by either pressing escape to select from the menu, or pressing control key combinations to access other functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EW doesn't have quite the feature set of WordPerfect, but it's much lighter--roughly 900k, of which 388k is the dictionary. Being small may not be sufficient excuse for being ugly and limited, though: if my brief foray into &lt;a href="http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~uv2s-oob/x68/index.html"&gt;historic Japanese sources&lt;/a&gt; (vintage 1989/1990--practically ancient!) doesn't mislead me, EW wasn't a well-regarded piece of software.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="1988"></category><category term="word processor"></category><category term="X68000"></category></entry><entry><title>Microsoft Word 5.0 (DOS) &amp; Microsoft Word 1.1 (Windows)</title><link href="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/microsoft-word-50-dos-microsoft-word-11-windows.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-06-19T19:29:22-04:00</updated><author><name>Tracy Poff</name></author><id>tag:sopoforic.github.io,2014-09-19:too-much-free-time/microsoft-word-50-dos-microsoft-word-11-windows.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Like the last post, this one is a double feature. Sadly, unlike WordPerfect 5.1, which was released for both DOS and Windows with the same version number, MS Word used different numbers for is DOS and Windows version. So I've arbitrarily picked a DOS and Windows version each released at around the same time as WordPerfect 5.1 to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="MS Word 5.0 for DOS" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/word_001.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On first glance, MS Word 5.0 for DOS, released in 1989, looks fairly similar to WordPerfect 5.1. It's a big blue screen with some status info at the bottom. But that's not quite all. In Word, the toolbar is constantly visible at the bottom, taking up several lines, and the text entry area is surrounded by a box. This box isn't just for show, though: you can choose to split the view into many different windows, which each may contain different documents. In practice, splitting the screen into more than two windows is probably not very useful, since the available space will be tiny, but it's still a nice feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the toolbar at the bottom, though, that's a waste of space. They should have just devoted a bit of space on the bottom line to say "Menu: Esc", or something, instead. I give them half credit for the interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="MS Word 1.1 for Windows" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/krnl386_004.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MS Word 1.1 for Windows, released in 1990, looks more like what we're familiar with from Word. With the standard menu-and-toolbar interface, it's a fairly usable word processor, even if it has some quirks in the display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word 1.1 does have a big flaw, though: when I tried to open in Word 1.1 the document I made in Word for DOS, it actually crashed DOSBox! It did successfully open the document I made in WordPerfect 5.1, though... I think I'm going to have to give this point to WordPerfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Libreoffice" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/2014-09-18_22-17-59.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, opening the documents I made in either the DOS or Windows version of Word in Libreoffice yields a bunch of garbage. I know that &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; it's not Word's fault if a piece of software written a quarter century later doesn't properly import its documents, but it's still a sad lack of longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, 1989's version of MS Word had some neat tricks with the multi-window interface, but I prefer the minimalist (and less-space-wasting) WordPerfect interface. WordPerfect 5.1 for Windows looks better than Word 1.1 for Windows, too, though both were apparently rather buggy, so they'll be winning no awards: above all, software must &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPerfect was still king of word processors at this point, but over the course of the 90s, its crown would be stolen by Word, leaving the once-mighty application little more than an also-ran, relegated to filling out the OEM software stack of budget PCs.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="1989"></category><category term="1990"></category><category term="DOS"></category><category term="Windows"></category><category term="word processor"></category></entry><entry><title>WordPerfect 5.1</title><link href="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/wordperfect-51.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-06-19T19:36:06-04:00</updated><author><name>Tracy Poff</name></author><id>tag:sopoforic.github.io,2014-09-16:too-much-free-time/wordperfect-51.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Technically, this blog is meant to be about video games. But I've written about &lt;a href="http://tmft.wordpress.com/2014/03/04/toshiba-t-3100-2/" title="Toshiba T-3100"&gt;hardware&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://tmft.wordpress.com/2013/06/05/ahoy-1-january-1984/" title="Ahoy! #1 (January 1984)"&gt;magazines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://tmft.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/a-parents-guide-to-computer-games/" title="A Parent’s Guide to Computer Games"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/first-impressions-text-editor.html" title="First Impressions: Text Editor"&gt;whatever this is&lt;/a&gt;, so I figure anything fitting broadly under the retrocomputing banner is fair game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="WordPerfect 5.1+ title screen" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/wp_000.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one may be familiar to you. WordPerfect 5.1, released in 1989, was quite a popular word processor, and it persisted for many years. In fact, &lt;a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~em36/wpdos/"&gt;it seems that&lt;/a&gt; people still want to use it to this day. It was used in my keyboarding class, in high school, so this is a bit of nostalgia for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A blank blue screen" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/wp_001.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you first open WordPerfect 5.1, you're greeted with a blank, blue screen, plus some details about the current position of the cursor. I'm fairly sure this violates a few interface design principles. On the other hand, considering that WordPerfect &lt;a href="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/2014-09-15_20-58-13.jpg"&gt;cost hundreds of dollars&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps they expected people to be willing to read the manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Formatting demonstration" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/wp_002.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you know how to use it, WordPerfect 5.1 is a powerful word processor, capable of doing pretty much anything you'd like. More modern word processors may be prettier, but all of the basic functions were there. The image above is what WordPerfect calls draft mode--a semi-WYSIWYG display suitable for general use. You could also turn on 'reveal codes' mode, which displays markup in a manner reminiscent of HTML or BBCode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A blank, blue screen is just so... [Italc On]inviting[Italc Off]... wouldn't you say?[HRt]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, when printed, the document would actually use italic or bold text, or whatever other formatting was selected. WordPerfect was intended, after all, for preparing documents for print, not for display on a computer screen. All of the various options could be accessed either though a menu (activated with Alt+=) or through some combination of modifier and function keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="WordPerfect 5.1 for Windows" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/krnl386_001.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows version of WordPerfect 5.1, released in 1991, defaults to a WYSIWYG view that should seem familiar modern computer users. It does still support draft mode and 'reveal codes' mode, for those who long for the (shall we say) simplicity of the DOS version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never used the Windows version of WordPerfect 5.1, back in the nineties. The word on the internet seems to be that it's very buggy, which is a shame, since it seems like a fairly usable word processor, otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="LibreOffice displaying the WordPerfect file" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/2014-09-15_19-49-43.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just for fun, I tried just double-clicking the document I saved in WP 5.1 for DOS, opening it in LibreOffice. As you can see, it opens and renders flawlessly, despite the programs being released 25 years apart--a true standard-bearer for backwards compatibility! It makes me wonder if the &lt;a href="http://www.wordperfect.com/us/"&gt;present incarnation of WordPerfect&lt;/a&gt; could do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could spend pages discussing all the features of WordPerfect 5.1, but I really just wanted a quick look at it, to allow for comparison, so this much will suffice. I'll write similar overviews of other contemporary word processors (Coming soon! Maybe.) and other applications, to show some of the variety in software on the market. There was a great deal of evolution in a fairly short time, so it should be interesting to see how they compare.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="1989"></category><category term="1991"></category><category term="DOS"></category><category term="Windows 3.x"></category><category term="word processor"></category></entry><entry><title>Donkey</title><link href="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/donkey.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-06-20T14:23:11-04:00</updated><author><name>Tracy Poff</name></author><id>tag:sopoforic.github.io,2008-01-01:too-much-free-time/donkey.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After far too long a break, a new game. Or, rather, quite an old one: Donkey, written in 1981 by Bill Gates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="DONKEY.BAS title screen" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/donkeyqb_000.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donkey was written&lt;sup id="fnref:wp"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:wp" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as a way to showcase the capabilities of the BASIC programming language which shipped with new IBM PCs. Therefore one might expect it to be a very simple game--and simple it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Gameplay" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/donkeyqb_001.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The object is to avoid the donkeys in the road as you drive. The controls consist of only a single button, the space bar, which is used to switch lanes. Each time you successfully pass a donkey, your car moves a bit closer to the top of the screen, so that it will be more difficult to switch in time to miss the next one. If you hit a donkey, the donkeys are given a point, you explode, and you start over:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Game Over" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/donkeyqb_003.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every eleventh donkey that you pass, you are reset to the center of the screen and given a point. The game keeps track of the score, but there's no particular reward for reaching any certain score; the game just continues until you exit. As simple and unrewarding as this game is, that's likely to be fairly soon after starting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: I've added a video demonstrating the gameplay below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Palamedes title screen" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Palamedes_02.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palamedes isn't quite the usual falling blocks game. Instead, rows of blocks approach and it is your task to remove them by hitting them with matching block. You select which block to throw at them (from a cycle of six) and try to keep up. It's something like Bust-a-Move, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few false starts, I made it to stage six. This one would probably be easier using a gamepad, but mine's loaned out, so take the apparent difficulty with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bump'n'Jump title screen" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/bump-n-jump_01.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Japanese version was called Buggy Popper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bump'n'Jump title screen" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/buggy-popper_01.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start with a car driving away, with someone crying "Help me!" inside. Being the heroic gamers that we are, this is sufficient motivation for us to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Help me!" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/bump-n-jump_08.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise of the game seems to be that we have a car which can jump at will, and we like to land on other cars and destroy them for no reason. Well, except that it gets us points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Jumping car" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/bump-n-jump_09.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever designed these roads needs to be shot. Apparently in the bizarro-world that this game take place in, cars normally have the ability to jump (but only yours does, as far as I saw), so in order to save some of the cost of roads, they just left out some sections. Yeah, that's logical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Road, interrupted" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/bump-n-jump_13.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, we can forgive some strangeness if it's a good game, right? Of course we can. Unfortunately, the designers decided to take all of my good will and stomp on it, by putting in a ludicrously long repair sequence when you drive over one of the bonuses on the road:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Repair sequence" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/bump-n-jump_15.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You sit at this screen for upwards of fifteen seconds while text flashes on screen assuring you that they are repairing your car and have not, in fact, run off with your money and girlfriend to Tijuana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you finally finish the first level, you are treated to the second level, in which the brilliant road designer decided that if there wasn't any water to break up the monotony, then we'd just have to build some raised roads to block the lower ones instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Not a tunnel!" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/bump-n-jump_21.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are helpful black areas that &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; like tunnels to pass through. They aren't. They are just there because the designer was sadistic. The problem is that if you jump any time when the little jump warning box is on the screen, you'll end up hitting the wall anyway, and it's much harder to figure out when to jump when you have to make it over a wall instead of just some water. You can't really tell how tall the thing is, since, as we all know, you should never do 3D on an NES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we crash and die, and the game ends. I don't know what happened to that car we were chasing earlier. Probably some girl was kidnapped, and since we couldn't catch her she was raped and killed. And it's all the road designer's fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verdict: There are worse games. This is like a mix of Spy Hunter and Roger Rabbit, and it doesn't do well at emulating either. Play Spy Hunter instead, since it had the good sense to give you guns for killing people with, and was a better game anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="driving"></category><category term="NES"></category><category term="1986"></category><category term="1988"></category><category term="Data East"></category><category term="Vic Tokai Inc."></category></entry><entry><title>First Impressions: 3D Block</title><link href="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/first-impressions-3d-block.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-06-20T14:11:42-04:00</updated><author><name>Tracy Poff</name></author><id>tag:sopoforic.github.io,2006-09-25:too-much-free-time/first-impressions-3d-block.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A falling blocks game, which appears from the title screen to be an adult game.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="3D Block title screen" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/3d-block_01.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll answer now, to spare you any anxiety: if it's an adult game, no one will ever know, because it's impossible to get anything done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Starting off" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/3d-block_03.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not too hard to rotate the shape when it's at the top, but once it gets further down it's nigh impossible to tell how it's oriented. Furthermore, it's very hard to tell at a glance what the levels below the top are like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Gameplay" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/3d-block_06.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is that box on the lower right? Is it supposed to help me guide my blocks? It shows four blocks per level. There are sixteen blocks per level in truth. I don't know how this is meant to help, but it's about as useful as dictionary with every other letter missing--you know there's more to it, but it doesn't do you any good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all these faults, the only thing that let me complete the first level was the the blocks fall slowly--painfully slowly. You can press start to drop the block all the way, but there's no way to move it down just a bit. When the second level comes, though, this isn't a problem. Where the first level was far too slow, the second level is impossibly fast. The blocks fall completely in about a second, which is nowhere near enough time to orient them, much less position them accurately. So, we get this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="About to lose" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/3d-block_08.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the game is thankfully over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verdict: This game shows why 3D should not be done on an NES.

One issue I found was that although everyone starts with equipment, it's not equipped, so you have to equip five items to each character, one at a time. An equip all feature would have been nice, but I guess you only have to do it once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graphics are actually pretty good for an NES game, as you see when walking around the town and then entering the world map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't play all the way through this, but it looks good so I probably will. One thing of note is that you don't have hit points in this game. Instead, you are (nominally) commanding an army, so you lose troops when attacked, and your damage is dependent on how many troops you have left. Strangely enough, though, herbs still 'heal' you and a revive still restores you to full 'health.' Possibly the designers weren't thinking it through very carefully. The battle screen is reminiscent of Final Fantasy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Battle" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/tenchi-wo-kurau-ii_08.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you win battles, you gain experience, and your army levels up. You gain some kind of skills, but I haven't played enough to see what they do yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verdict: This seems like a good game. The graphics are nice and the battle system, while simple, is reasonably good. If it continues as it has begun, this game will probably be worth playing through.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="good"></category><category term="NES"></category><category term="rpg"></category><category term="ancient China"></category><category term="Capcom"></category><category term="fan translation"></category></entry><entry><title>First Impressions: Tasac</title><link href="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/first-impressions-tasac.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-06-20T12:17:36-04:00</updated><author><name>Tracy Poff</name></author><id>tag:sopoforic.github.io,2006-09-24:too-much-free-time/first-impressions-tasac.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tasac is a vertical scrolling shooter by Sachen, and it sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title screen looks pretty cool, so one might expect the game to have decent graphics, or something. Most of your in-game time is spent in a position like this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tasac gameplay" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Tasac_04.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no real challenge in this part, except that the laser-like weapon you start with sucks, and the upgrades suck even more. When you get to the end, the boss appears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tasac pre-boss" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Tasac_07.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can't kill it yet. In fact, you can fly right over it. Why is the boss there before you're able to interact with it? I don't know. But the game carries on just as if the boss weren't there. In fact, it carries on the same way even once you can fight the boss--the random enemies keep appearing, there's just a boss on the screen at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tasac boss fight" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Tasac_09.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the boss shoots a pretty large number of projectiles at you, they're not hard to dodge. If the weapon weren't so stupidly slow and hard to use, they boss wouldn't be even slightly difficult. As it is, the boss just takes a little longer than it ought to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second level was just like the first. I think that the boss was slightly rounder, but I don't really care to recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verdict: Pointless. It's just a below average vertical scroller.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="bad"></category><category term="NES"></category><category term="vertical scrolling shooter"></category><category term="futuristic"></category><category term="not on mobygames"></category><category term="Sachen"></category><category term="Thin Chen"></category><category term="1992"></category></entry><entry><title>First Impressions: Text Editor</title><link href="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/first-impressions-text-editor.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-06-20T11:58:27-04:00</updated><author><name>Tracy Poff</name></author><id>tag:sopoforic.github.io,2006-09-24:too-much-free-time/first-impressions-text-editor.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Original title: ""РЕДАКТОР ТЕКСТОВ"".

I hit 'random game I haven't played' and I got this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Flying Warriors title screen" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Flying-Warriors_01.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flying Warriors. It sounds like some kind of shooter maybe. Airplane game. That's cool, I liked 1943. So, what do I get? Castlevania if it sucked and had a boring training sequence. But before training, some important wisdom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Advice" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Flying-Warriors_02.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, on to the training. Since the designers went to all the trouble of putting in training, this game must have some complex controls, or something. Let's see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Controls" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Flying-Warriors_03.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Controls" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Flying-Warriors_20.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Controls" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Flying-Warriors_05.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Controls" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Flying-Warriors_22.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Controls" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Flying-Warriors_06.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Controls" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Flying-Warriors_08.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that's right. Toward automatically blocks at the right level, and B automatically punches at the right level. You get to practice these complex manoeuvres several times before you grasp them fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Success!" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Flying-Warriors_09.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! I am a master! I can now go out and make the world a better place! But, first, a practice match against sensei. Well, sure. I'm a master now. Piece of cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Fight with sensei" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Flying-Warriors_10.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we fight and... he beats me down. Badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Have you no pride!" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Flying-Warriors_11.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it's back to training. Never mind that training couldn't possibly help me, and that a monkey could manage these controls. So, we train again, he declares me a master again, we fight again, I lose again. Repeat. Repeat...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I win. So we get a scene change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Rick is alone in the mountains as usual." src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Flying-Warriors_12.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Empty screen" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Flying-Warriors_13.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the game begins with an exciting... empty screen! I have to move off it to an entirely different scene to get to the actual game. What was the point? Why waste my time putting this scene in if there's nothing here? The next scene is some kind of mountain area, which kind of matches with the description, but that does not explain what the point of this last scene was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Gameplay" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Flying-Warriors_15.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after that painfully long training and practice fight, we expect challenge, yes? But the enemies all die in one hit! The hardest part is managing the movement controls, since it seems to be impossible to make Rick (our hero) jump the way you want him to. After a couple of screens full of these zombie-like wimps, we enter a cave, filled with more of the same, as well as the far more dangerous bottomless pits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pits?" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Flying-Warriors_17.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, these pits are so much more dangerous, that they even kill the enemies, who just jump off like lemmings. But, remember how I said that jumping correctly was the hardest part?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pits!" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Flying-Warriors_18.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I too jump off like a lemming. The game tells me that Rick doesn't let this stop him. Fortunately, it does stop me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verdict: You can't skip the long intro, you have to go through boring training and practice fights, only to get to a game that acts like a bad rip off of Castlevania. Better to leave this one alone.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="1990"></category><category term="bad"></category><category term="beat 'em up"></category><category term="NES"></category><category term="Culture Brain Inc."></category></entry><entry><title>First Impressions: The 3-D Battles of World Runner</title><link href="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/first-impressions-the-3-d-battles-of-world-runner.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-06-20T11:23:05-04:00</updated><author><name>Tracy Poff</name></author><id>tag:sopoforic.github.io,2006-09-24:too-much-free-time/first-impressions-the-3-d-battles-of-world-runner.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Run around, avoiding the enemies, until you get to the boss.

&lt;p&gt;It's kind of dull, since all there is to do is move forward, at varying rates of speed, and jump. You get a rocket, which actually looks like a pink fireball when you use it, but I can't imagine what it's good for since any enemy you hit with the rocket wouldn't have been there when you actually run past it, and the enemies which weren't in your line of fire will run into you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="World Runner gameplay" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/3-D-Battles-of-World-Runner_02.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to jump over some pits as you go. Since the game doesn't have real 3D, you can't really tell how wide the pits are until you're in the air, so you have to try to land in the right spot by changing speed in the air. Sometimes you have only a small area to land, so I kept overshooting or actually smacking my face on the edge of the ground and then sliding down to my death. When you finish the level you fight this centipede-thing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="World Runner boss" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/3-D-Battles-of-World-Runner_03.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a picture from before the game starts, since I neglected to take a screenshot while actually fighting it. Suffice to say you fire the pink rocket-fireballs at it until it dies. I have no clue how it is intended to hurt you, since it doesn't seem to have any rockets of its own. Or arms. Or anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second level is like the first, except grey. I assume that the others follow suit. The game also has an anaglyph 3D mode, activated by pressing select. I have not yet mustered the courage to try this.&lt;/p&gt;

The title screen greets us, for some reason, with some weird balloon horse things bouncing around:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="1991 Du Ma Racing title screen" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/1991-Du-Ma-Racing_01.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the balloon horses were supposed to liven the game up. If so, they failed. There are two modes: race mode and gamble mode. I didn't want to contemplate what might cause you to want to bet on a race controlled by the computer with no real rewards, so I chose race mode. Presumably, it was intended for two players, but it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="1991 Du Ma Racing gameplay" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/1991-Du-Ma-Racing_02.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the little bars with the red balls near them, at the bottom? Those balls were bouncing up and down, and the object was (I deduced) to hit B when yours crossed the center line. Sort of like DDR. Even granted you could find someone else bored enough to play this game, it would be pointless, since it's all but impossible &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; to hit the button at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is this the only apparent 'challenge' in the game, it goes on forever. You have to go all the way around the track hitting B every half second or so, and that's it. The view switches to overhead when you're on the side of the track, but that doesn't matter since it's still exactly the same worthless game it was when the view was side-on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one has more features than &lt;a href="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/first-impressions-1942.html"&gt;its predecessor&lt;/a&gt;, such as the ability to configure your plane before you start:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, when you start, it tells you briefly what your target is. In the first level, it's Rikaku, the Japanese Heavy Cruiser:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="1943 target" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/1943-The-Battle-of-Midway_03.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is 1942, you're piloting a P-38, which you can improve as you play by picking up better weapons and energy bonuses. The gameplay is the same, too: fire at the enemy planes (and ships) while avoiding being hit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="1943 ingame" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/1943-The-Battle-of-Midway_04.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the level, you fight Rikaku, which is heavily armed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Rikaku" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/1943-The-Battle-of-Midway_08.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you win, you move on to the next level. There are a total of 24 levels in the NES version, as compared to 16 in the arcade version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start the game running down the field, and quickly meet the opposing team:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="10-Yard Fight gameplay" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/10-Yard-Fight_03.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This scene repeats, with the referee running out every few seconds, since I'm tackled every time I move. I don't think there are any controls except 'throw ball before running' and 'run.' Once I mastered this fiendishly clever control scheme, it was just a matter of seeing whether my patience or the field ran out first. It turns out that my patience won, so I got the joy of getting to the end--then starting again! Pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little searching tells me that if I had been willing to spend a half hour playing this game, I'd have gotten to play defense as well as offense. Fortunately, everyone seems to agree that it's be stupid to waste that much time on this one, so I'll bow to the wisdom of the internets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not too bad. You control the plane, which moves pretty smoothly, and shoot the enemies. A rather basic idea, but workable:&lt;/p&gt;
