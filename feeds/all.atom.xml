&lt;p&gt;Recently, I saw a new game from &lt;a href="http://www.zachtronics.com/"&gt;Zachtronics Industries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;TIS-100&lt;/em&gt;, which was released &lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/370360/"&gt;on Steam&lt;/a&gt; as an early access title on the first of June. In some ways, calling it a game is overstating it: it's little more than a collection of programming problems, with a little story to give it some structure. The catch is that you're programming in an assembly language on a virtual machine with unusual architecture; problems beyond the simplest will generally require you to take advantage of parallelism (which is the primary distinguishing feature of the VM), resulting in novel solutions for ordinary problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TIS-100 game screen" src="http://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/370360_2015-06-17_00005.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, a game like that has a rather limited target audience. Case in point: I have myself previously created a little VM with a fake assembly language to play with. The game is clearly made just for me, but how many others are likely to be similarly interested? About 11,000,&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; so far. It's a minor hit.&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of programming as gameplay isn't new. Indeed, Zachtronics's earlier game, &lt;em&gt;SpaceChem&lt;/em&gt;, is also an exercise in parallel programming, though dressed up in fancier clothes. Way back in the mists of time,&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;em&gt;Robot Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; challenged players to program the titular robots to solve puzzles. And on the more-programming-than-game end of the spectrum, we have &lt;em&gt;Core War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and a multitude of web sites in the vein of &lt;a href="https://projecteuler.net/"&gt;Project Euler&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.codingame.com/home"&gt;CodinGame&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been enjoying &lt;em&gt;TIS-100&lt;/em&gt;, but more than that, I think it's singularly impressive to release a game of this kind. Certainly, there are games that trade on their difficulty (&lt;em&gt;Super Hexagon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;I Wanna Be the Guy&lt;/em&gt;, etc.) and some that take pride in their difficulty of interaction (&lt;em&gt;Surgeon Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ampu-Tea&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;QWOP&lt;/em&gt;, etc.), and simple 'retro-style' graphics are &lt;em&gt;de rigueur&lt;/em&gt; for indie games, but the very minimalistic functionalism of &lt;em&gt;TIS-100&lt;/em&gt; is astounding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TIS-100&lt;/em&gt; is difficult because the thinking required to solve the puzzles is difficult. It is perhaps inaccessible, because it consists of nothing else &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; the tools to solve the puzzle. Its graphics are simple because everything you need to solve the puzzles is a text-mode interactive debugger, and that's what you get. Like a sudoku puzzle or a crossword, &lt;em&gt;TIS-100&lt;/em&gt; is a completely pure puzzle game: the game takes place in your head, and the software keeps score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not by chance that &lt;em&gt;TIS-100&lt;/em&gt; so distinguishes itself from other games. During the production of &lt;em&gt;Infinifactory&lt;/em&gt;, Zach Barth, the founder of Zachtronics, wanted to make a game with a smaller team--something more-indie-than-indie--to get back to his roots as an indie developer. The project turned out to be too great in scope, but from its wreckage was salvaged a programming minigame which became &lt;em&gt;TIS-100&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Viewed as an indie developer's attempt to make something &lt;em&gt;even more indie&lt;/em&gt;, with the understanding that it was a small part of something larger, the design makes sense.&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game's manual, too, reflects the niche targeted by the game. Who reads a manual, you ask? When it is positioned as a technical document describing the instruction set of a virtual machine, the answer to that question is: programmers. The manual is presented as the in-universe manual for the TIS-100 computer, previously the property of the player character's Uncle Randy, including handwritten notes and highlighting. This was part of Zachtronics's attempt to make a game with "an irresistible value proposition. For us, that's a game with a 14-page technical manual that we designed, printed out, marked up and scanned back in again."&lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The manual is reminiscent of the feelies accompanying Infocom games, among others, in years past.&lt;sup id="fnref:8"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TIS-100 results screen" src="http://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/370360_2015-06-18_00001.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like its predecessor, &lt;em&gt;SpaceChem&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;TIS-100&lt;/em&gt; encourages players to perfect their solutions, optimizing for either execution speed, least number of nodes used, or least instructions--goals which are often contradictory, requiring multiple solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, given that it is a game about programming, the players of &lt;em&gt;TIS-100&lt;/em&gt; have created some auxiliary tools, including &lt;a href="http://www.tis100pad.com/"&gt;TIS-100 PAD&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;sup id="fnref:9"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which allows users to more easily share solutions, and a variety of TIS-100 (the virtual machine, not the game) emulators.&lt;sup id="fnref:10"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to this unsolicited community participation, with the release of the specification editor, which allows players to make their own puzzles, a puzzle design contest was announced. Twenty-five puzzles will be selected from the submissions for an official bonus campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feel of &lt;em&gt;TIS-100&lt;/em&gt; is both nostalgic and quite modern. It's an intriguing combination, and I recommend it to anyone still interested after hearing me call it "a collection of programming problems." Coders, no prior experience with assembly is needed. Others, if you like this game--try coding. You'll probably like that, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1984, actually.

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also from 1984, described in a Scientific American article, [Dewdney1984]. It's based on a still earlier programming game, &lt;em&gt;Darwin&lt;/em&gt;, which was played in 1961 and described publicly in 1972. See [McIlroy1971] for more.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Barth wrote in a post mortem of &lt;em&gt;SpaceChem&lt;/em&gt;, [Barth2012], that &lt;em&gt;SpaceChem&lt;/em&gt; was too difficult and inaccessible. New titles were forthcoming: "New titles, I might add, that are hopefully more accessible than &lt;em&gt;SpaceChem&lt;/em&gt;!"&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:6" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But I am writing about a good game, at least: &lt;em&gt;Bleed Out Sakuretsu&lt;/em&gt;, a vertically scrolling shooter for the Sharp X68000, by Gold Cats Project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Bleed-Out-Sakuretsu-title.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First: yes, the title screen says 'sakuretu'. But the common romanization of this game's title seems to be 'sakuretsu', and as goes TOSEC, so goes my nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Bleed-Out-Sakuretsu-ingame.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleed Out Sakuretsu&lt;/em&gt; has a powerup system reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;Gradius&lt;/em&gt;. As you continue scoring points, you can purchase a shot upgrade, a barrier, or other, even more powerful powerups. The opposition is a variety of ships, small shots, and guided missiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Bleed-Out-Sakuretsu-boss.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boss sprays out bullets danmaku-style, and periodically fires a pair of front-facing lasers. You've got to deal with this while avoiding guided missiles, and since you are destroyed in one shot (unless you buy a barrier), this, like the rest of the level, provides a good challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, an unfortunate revelation: the boss is, as far as I can tell, invulnerable, because the available version of &lt;em&gt;Bleed Out Sakuretsu&lt;/em&gt; is a trial edition, and I can find no evidence that any full version was ever created. I would love to hear otherwise, if anyone has better information on old doujin games than I do, because it's a very fun game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMZdr6LtHT8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to do a shooter justice with just words and screenshots. The video above shows (I believe) the entire game, which should give a much better picture of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like shooters, I'd say &lt;em&gt;Bleed Out Sakuretsu&lt;/em&gt; is worth a try. It's only about two minutes long, but it's fun, and I believe there's a place for brief games, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Touhou&lt;/em&gt; series looms largest on the doujin shooter landscape, of course, but there's a huge and fascinating variety of games (of all genres) stretching back decades, which I think could use some more attention from the English-speaking web. I'll probably be looking at a few more doujin games in coming weeks, so I'll try to shine a light on whichever titles catch my eye. Maybe there will be some hidden gems, or maybe just hidden failures. We'll see what comes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="doujin shooter"></category><category term="Gold Cats Project"></category><category term="not on mobygames"></category><category term="vaporware"></category><category term="1996"></category><category term="x68000"></category><category term="vertical scrolling shooter"></category><category term="good"></category></entry><entry><title>History Mystery</title><link href="http://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/history-mystery.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-06-19T13:47:29-04:00</updated><author><name>Tracy Poff</name></author><id>tag:sopoforic.github.io,2015-03-12:too-much-free-time/history-mystery.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the early eighties, the sudden popularity (and, indeed, the recent &lt;em&gt;existence&lt;/em&gt;) of home computers gave rise to a new kind of publication: the disk magazine. These periodicals were published not on paper but on computer disks (and sometimes cassettes), and although the content varied, they generally featured computer programs (including games) in addition to, or even in place of, articles. The most famous of these are perhaps &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softdisk_(disk_magazine)"&gt;Softdisk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for the Apple II (launched in 1981) and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loadstar"&gt;Loadstar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for the Commodore 64 (launched in 1984). The medium flourished&lt;sup id="fnref:diskmags"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:diskmags" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; alongside more traditional magazines which might offer (inconvenient!) type-in programs. There was a price to be paid for this convenience: a single 'issue' of &lt;em&gt;Softdisk&lt;/em&gt; cost about the same as an annual subscription to a paper magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the many disk mags was Scholastic's &lt;em&gt;Microzine&lt;/em&gt; for Apple II. Featuring (as you might expect) primarily educational content, &lt;em&gt;Microzine&lt;/em&gt; began publication in 1983,&lt;sup id="fnref:micropub"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:micropub" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; continuing for about a decade. It also inspired a spin-off series, &lt;em&gt;Microzine Jr.&lt;/em&gt;, which was launched in 1988. Each issue of &lt;em&gt;Microzine&lt;/em&gt; included four programs, one of which was a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="History Mystery title scree" src="http://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Microzine18.Sid_000000004.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which all brings me to the subject of this article: &lt;em&gt;History Mystery&lt;/em&gt; by David A. Bowman and &lt;a href="http://www.highcastle.com/MarkHome/mark.htm"&gt;Mark A. Malamud&lt;/a&gt;, which was included in &lt;em&gt;Microzine&lt;/em&gt; #18 in November 1986. According to the '&lt;a href="https://tmft.wordpress.com/?attachment_id=945"&gt;Letter from the Editor&lt;/a&gt;' in that issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll have fun reading &lt;strong&gt;The History Mystery&lt;/strong&gt; Twistaplot™ adventure. A priceless hourglass has been stolen from the Microville History Museum. Some of the ghosts in the museum will help you find it. (Yes, the museum is haunted!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You play the part of "the ace reporter of your school newspaper, &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;The Chronicle&lt;/span&gt;" (incidentally, &lt;a href="https://tmft.wordpress.com/?attachment_id=953"&gt;of selectable gender&lt;/a&gt;), out to get a story about a stolen Babylonian hourglass. After chatting with the ghost of Mark Twain about the situation, you find yourself in the lobby of the museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Museum lobby" src="http://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Microzine18.Sid_000000014.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The museum consists of 29 rooms&lt;sup id="fnref:map"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:map" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which you must navigate, gathering items and clues to solve the mystery of the stolen hourglass, which the museum's ghosts believe is actually located within the museum. Each room has a description, seen on entering the room, and an entry in the self-guided tape-recorded tour, accessed by pressing &lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;. The tour often contained educational information&lt;sup id="fnref:tour"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:tour" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which might be used to solve the game's puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Age of Dinosaurs room" src="http://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/Microzine18.Sid_000000019.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some rooms have items to be collected, while others have ghosts to talk to or other objects to interact with. The game is in two parts (purely for practical reasons, I presume). Selecting the second part from the menu requires the player to input the password given at the end of the first part ("The Sands of Time") and begins the second part, in which the player must collect the hourglass and escape the museum while being chased by Winsome Slugg, the criminal who had stolen it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tracy's Gift Shop" src="http://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/tracys-gift-shop.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon completing the game, the player gets a rather neat reward: the museum's gift shop, called "Amy Minkley's Gift Shop",&lt;sup id="fnref:giftshop"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:giftshop" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; will be renamed after the player. Not only in the ending text, either: in future playthroughs, the in-game name is changed. Which, I suppose, might make this the first game with a New Game+ feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;History Mystery&lt;/em&gt; took me about an hour to complete, though I suppose it took me quite a bit longer when I was a child. I remember having a lot of fun with it, back then, and it's still neat as a bit of nostalgia, today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tales of Suspense" src="http://sopoforic.github.io/too-much-free-time/images/tales-of-suspense.jpg" /&gt;
My copy of the game is this 1987 compilation, &lt;em&gt;Tales of Suspense&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll try to look at some more games from &lt;em&gt;Microzine&lt;/em&gt; and other disk mags in the future. There's a lot to be said about them, and the resources on the internet are scarce at best. This post has been several years in the making, during which time I've been contacted a number of times by people who, like me, had fond memories of a game which &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; have been &lt;em&gt;History Mystery&lt;/em&gt;, but who couldn't be sure. My thanks to them for providing me the impetus to do my civic duty and get this out there. Fans of old educational games, you are appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"...Welcome to the Telephone Exhibit. The first telephone call was made by Alexander Graham Bell.

Ferguson&lt;/a&gt;, to be published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Communication&lt;/em&gt;, which argues that the common belief that there is a positive correlation between media violence and societal violence is false. The abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article presents 2 studies of the association of media violence rates with societal violence rates. In the first study, movie violence and homicide rates are examined across the 20th century and into the 21st (1920–2005). Throughout the mid-20th century small-to-moderate correlational relationships can be observed between movie violence and homicide rates in the United States. This trend reversed in the early and latter 20th century, with movie violence rates inversely related to homicide rates. In the second study, videogame violence consumption is examined against youth violence rates in the previous 2 decades. Videogame consumption is associated with a decline in youth violence rates. Results suggest that societal consumption of media violence is not predictive of increased societal violence rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The article, briefly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the full article is about twenty pages, I'll summarize it here, with a bit more detail than the abstract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferguson begins by establishing that there is not general agreement in the literature as to correlation (much less causation) between media violence and societal violence. He particularly argues that that laboratory studies which show an increase in aggression (e.g. an increased tendency to fill in missing letters in words to create violent words) following consumption of violent media may not correspond to increased societal violence (e.g. homicide).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first study analyzes the relationship between violence in movies and homicide, between 1920 and 2005. To assess violence in movies, the top five grossing movies per year were taken at five-year intervals, and graded for violent content. This data was compared to statistics for murder and (non-negligent) homicide during the same years. Ferguson concludes that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together these data suggest that perceived correlations between movie and societal violence were associated with a chance concordance during the mid-20th century. Given that these phenomena were not in concordance in either the early or latter 20th century, it appears that efforts to establish causal connections between movie and societal violence based on a select set of decades were an ecological fallacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second study analyzes the relationship between violence in video games and youth violence for the years 1996 to 2011. Ferguson uses sales data from IMDb and the ESA and takes the ratings assigned by the ESRB as a proxy for violent content. He concludes that there is a "remarkably strong" inverse relationship between violent video game consumption and youth violence and that, although this is no indication of causality, "Evidence from societal data does not support claims of dramatic videogame violence effects on violence among youth."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Ferguson argues that alternate methods should be used in the future when assessing the effect of media consumption on behavior, and that professional organizations such as the APA should "retire their policy statements on media violence as such statements tend to be misleading and may cause more harm than good." Furthermore, "Arguably, given that the results from the effects paradigm have been weak and inconsistent, it may be time for scholars to make less rather than more conclusive statements to news media regarding media effects on society."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unaddressed questions and other problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferguson's conclusion in the first study (namely that positive correlation between media violence and societal violence is limited to a mid-century concordance) seems undeniable. I am not similarly satisfied with the second study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious problem with the second study is that it addresses a period of only sixteen years, and in particular that it does not even consider whether the change in rate of youth violence differed before and after the introduction of video games. Given that Ferguson strongly criticized reliance on data from a limited time span in the first study, this is fairly damning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the second study does not argue that &lt;em&gt;generally&lt;/em&gt; increased video game consumption corresponds to an increase in the consumption of &lt;em&gt;violent&lt;/em&gt; video games &lt;em&gt;by youths&lt;/em&gt;. I freely admit that it is likely that this is true, but the study makes no mention of it. In general, I am not convinced by Ferguson's 'just look at the top five games according to IMDb' approach to analyzing the state of gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, the study blithely dismisses any correlation between increased incarceration and decreased youth violence, on strength of &lt;a href="http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ875143"&gt;a paper by Stahlkopf, Males, and Macallair&lt;/a&gt;. Based on its abstract, that paper only concludes that increased &lt;em&gt;juvenile&lt;/em&gt; incarceration does not lead to reduced crime (specifically in California). It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible that the full paper has more useful (for Ferguson) conclusions, but I do not have access to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, the graphs in the paper are unclear as to what exactly is depicted. Figure 3, "Societal videogame violence consumption and societal youth violence, 1996-2011.", is a double chart with yearly figures for the two measures in question, with scales ranging from 0-9000 for one and 0-40 for the other. 9000 what? 40 what? I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifth, without commenting on the sensibility of the suggestions Ferguson makes, I would say that his statements in the "Theoretical implications" section are not supported by the studies. Ferguson argues that different theoretical approaches should be used in studying the relationship between media violence and societal violence, essentially by mentioning a variety of alternatives without arguing for their particular effectiveness. Such arguments would be better suited to a paper which actually considers the relative merit of the various approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixth, the "Policy implications" section reads like a conspiracy theory. Selections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a matter of policy, consistent with the statement by the Consortium of Scholars (2013)...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...media-based policy statements released by professional organizations have so often been revealed to be flawed (e.g., Ferguson, 2013;Magid, 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...it has been revealed that past policy statements were typically
developed by specially selected researchers heavily invested in antimedia views, with no dissenting voices (Ferguson, 2013).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, problems have been 'revealed' &lt;em&gt;by the author of this paper&lt;/em&gt;. The 'statement by the Consortium of Scholars' mentioned is an open letter of which Ferguson is a signatory, and the source of which is &lt;em&gt;Ferguson's personal website&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id="fnref:homepage"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:homepage" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reference to Magid links to a paper published in &lt;em&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt; (by O'Keeffe and Clarke-Pearson), but the actual reference listed is to an article in &lt;em&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt; which responds to (and disputes) the journal article. Why Ferguson would obfuscatingly link to the article in &lt;em&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt; rather than the one in &lt;em&gt;HuffPo&lt;/em&gt; to which he actually referred is a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, take note of "...some scholars have argued...(Males, 2013)." That reference is not to a scholarly paper, but what seems to be simply an opinion piece published by YouthFacts.org.&lt;sup id="fnref:broken"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:broken" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the actual studies in the paper seem fairly inoffensive, but do not support the discussion. It seems very like Ferguson wanted to pontificate about perceived problems in his field, and conducted a couple of very minor studies in order to have an excuse for publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Caveats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I have not studied psychology. I studied math at uni, so except insofar as the paper uses statistical analyses, I have no formal education relevant to this paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, as I do not have access to a university library, I have not been able to review all of the paper's references. It is possible that some or all of my objections were answered by the cited papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, I am (obviously) a gamer, and inclined to agree with the &lt;em&gt;results&lt;/em&gt; of the studies in this paper, despite my objections to the academic rigour of the paper. It is possible that I have been too lenient with the studies for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;
